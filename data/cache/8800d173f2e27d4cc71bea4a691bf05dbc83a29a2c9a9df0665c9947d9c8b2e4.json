  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.03023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers introduced PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework designed to improve access to open data for non-experts. By breaking down tasks into specialized agents, the system enhances focus and reduces errors during data analysis. Evaluation of five models revealed that even the strongest model achieved a 97.5% win rate in agent performance. This development is significant as it could democratize data analysis, making evidence-based decision-making more accessible.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Non-experts can now engage with complex datasets without needing advanced skills, simplifying their decision-making processes.",
    "This framework signals a shift towards more user-friendly data analysis tools, potentially transforming how organizations leverage public data."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "PublicAgent is like having a team of specialists instead of a single expert. Each agent focuses on a specific task, making it easier for anyone to analyze data without deep knowledge. This matters for everyday people because it could help them make informed decisions based on available data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, PublicAgent addresses user needs by simplifying data analysis processes. It offers a cost-effective solution by improving efficiency across workflows, which could lead to better insights and faster decision-making. This means teams can focus on strategy rather than getting bogged down in data complexity.",
    "engineer": "Technically, PublicAgent employs specialized agents to handle distinct tasks in data analysis, enhancing attention and reducing error propagation. Evaluation showed that even the most robust model maintained a 97.5% win rate, with consistent performance across tasks. This architecture highlights the importance of model-aware design to optimize agent effectiveness."
