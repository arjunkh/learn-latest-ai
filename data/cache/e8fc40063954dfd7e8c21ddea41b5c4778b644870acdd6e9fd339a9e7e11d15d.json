  "speedrun": "Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a method for breaking down complex time series data into simpler components. It helps identify patterns by separating signals into intrinsic mode functions. This is particularly useful in fields like finance and environmental science, where understanding underlying trends can drive better decision-making. As data complexity grows, mastering EMD could enhance how we analyze and interpret time series data.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and analysts can gain clearer insights from complex data, leading to more informed decisions in their respective fields.",
    "As industries increasingly rely on data-driven strategies, EMD represents a shift towards more intuitive and accessible analytical tools."

    "eli12": "Empirical Mode Decomposition is like peeling an onion; you remove layers to see what's inside. It helps break down complicated data into simpler parts, making it easier to spot trends. This method is important for anyone dealing with data, as it can lead to clearer insights and better outcomes in everyday decisions.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding EMD could enhance user experience by providing clearer data insights. This method can reduce costs associated with data analysis by simplifying complex signals. Implementing EMD could lead to more effective features that help users make sense of their data.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Empirical Mode Decomposition allows for the extraction of intrinsic mode functions from non-linear and non-stationary time series data. This method improves upon traditional Fourier transforms by adapting to the data's characteristics. However, practitioners should be aware of the computational intensity involved in processing large datasets."
