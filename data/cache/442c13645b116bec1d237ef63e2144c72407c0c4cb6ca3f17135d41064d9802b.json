  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.16814v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored the gap in visual creativity between humans and AI models, focusing on image generation. It found that visual artists produced the most creative images, followed by non-artists, while AI outputs varied based on human input. Specifically, images generated with high human guidance approached the creativity of non-artists. This highlights the unique challenges AI faces in visual domains, which could impact future developments in creative AI applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Visual artists may need to adapt to AI tools that currently lack nuanced creativity, affecting their workflows. This could shift how creative professionals engage with technology.",
    "The findings suggest a broader trend where AI excels in language tasks but struggles with visual creativity, potentially shaping future AI training methods and applications."

    "eli12": "This study looked at how humans and AI create images. It found that artists are more creative than AI, especially when AI gets help from humans. Imagine a student who does better on a test with a tutor. This matters because it shows that while AI can help, it still needs human input to reach its creative potential.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the varying effectiveness of AI in creative tasks. Understanding that AI needs significant human guidance to match non-artists in creativity could inform product design. It emphasizes the importance of user input in enhancing AI tools, which could lead to better user experiences and outcomes.",
    "engineer": "The study compared creativity in image generation across human artists and AI using two prompting conditions. Results showed a clear hierarchy in creativity: visual artists topped the list, followed by non-artists, then AI outputs based on human guidance. This suggests that while AI can generate images, it struggles with the perceptual nuance required for true creativity, pointing to limitations in current generative models."
