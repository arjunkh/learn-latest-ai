    "eli12": "Stardust Solutions wants to cool the planet using technology that could change how we deal with climate change. Think of it like turning down the thermostat in a house that's getting too hot. This matters because as climate issues worsen, innovative ideas like this could offer new ways to protect our environment.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Stardust's approach highlights a growing user need for climate solutions that blend technology and sustainability. It suggests a potential market for geoengineering services, possibly leading to new business models. Understanding this trend could help in developing products that align with environmental goals.",
    "engineer": "Stardust Solutions is leveraging geoengineering techniques to propose a method for cooling the planet, though specific models or benchmarks were not detailed. The startup's approach could involve large-scale interventions, which raises questions about feasibility and environmental impact. Such initiatives require careful consideration of both technical execution and ethical implications."
