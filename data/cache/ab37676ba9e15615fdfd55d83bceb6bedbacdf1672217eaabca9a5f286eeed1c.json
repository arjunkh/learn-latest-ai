  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.06302v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience. The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed framework through iterative design and real-world validation.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study proposes a game-based learning design framework to improve training for information system integration during post-merger integration. It highlights that traditional methods like AMILI and AMILP face challenges such as high learning curves and low motivation. By applying engaging game design principles, the framework aims to make learning more effective. This approach matters now as organizations increasingly rely on successful mergers, making efficient training essential for integration success.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Professionals involved in information system integration could benefit from more engaging training methods, which may enhance their skills and motivation.",
    "This shift towards game-based learning reflects a broader trend in corporate training, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to complex challenges."

    "eli12": "This study suggests that using games for training can make learning about complex systems more fun and effective. Just like learning to drive is easier with a driving simulator, professionals could grasp information system integration better through interactive experiences. This matters for everyday people because better training could lead to smoother transitions during company mergers, affecting job stability and service quality.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights an opportunity to enhance training tools for employees involved in mergers. By focusing on user engagement through game-based learning, companies could reduce training time and improve retention of complex information. This could lead to more efficient integration processes, ultimately benefiting overall business performance.",
    "engineer": "The paper emphasizes the need for a game-based learning framework that addresses the cognitive load and motivation in training for information system integration. It draws on established learning theories and serious game design frameworks to create a structured approach. Key specifics include the transformation process and the resulting learning experience, which could lead to more effective training outcomes in real-world applications."
