    "eli12": "This tutorial shows how to use k-Means clustering in Excel, which helps group similar data points together. Think of it like sorting your closet by color or type, making it easier to find what you need. This matters because it enables more people to analyze data without needing complex programming skills.",
    "pm": "For product managers, integrating k-Means in Excel addresses user needs for straightforward data analysis tools. It could reduce costs associated with training on complex software. A practical implication is that teams can now quickly visualize data patterns, enhancing decision-making processes.",
    "engineer": "The tutorial explains how to implement k-Means clustering in Excel, a method that partitions data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity. Key specifics include the algorithm's reliance on distance metrics to form these clusters. While this approach simplifies access to machine learning, engineers should note Excel's limitations in handling large datasets efficiently."
