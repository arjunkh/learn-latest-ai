  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.07964v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper highlights how Executable Ontologies (EO) could transform game development by shifting from strict algorithmic programming to a more flexible semantic world modeling approach. Using the boldsea framework, the authors demonstrate EO's ability to manage agent behavior through declarative rules, which allows for more natural interactions. In a survival game scenario, EO effectively handles task interruptions based on dataflow conditions. This shift could lead to more dynamic and responsive game AI, making it a significant development in the industry.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Game developers could enhance player experiences by creating more responsive and intelligent AI characters, improving engagement.",
    "This approach could signal a broader shift in AI design, moving toward more adaptable systems that better understand context and semantics."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Executable Ontologies (EO) change how games handle character behavior. Instead of following strict rules, characters act based on the game's context, like how a friend might react differently depending on the situation. This makes games feel more alive and engaging for players, enhancing their experience.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, EO could streamline game development by reducing the complexity of coding behaviors. This approach allows teams to focus more on creative aspects rather than rigid programming. Implementing EO may lead to more efficient development cycles and richer gameplay experiences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, EO shifts the focus from behavior modeling to semantic conditions, addressing the semantic-process gap in game AI. Unlike Behavior Trees and Goal-Oriented Action Planning, EO determines when actions can occur based on dataflow, rather than just what they should do. This could enhance the flexibility and realism of AI behaviors in games."
