    "eli12": "This article explains how CPUs and GPUs work together like a team in a relay race. The CPU is the one who starts the race, managing tasks, while the GPU takes over for the fast-paced running, handling lots of data at once. This teamwork is important because it helps make AI applications run smoother and faster for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding the host-device paradigm is key to meeting user demands for speed and efficiency. By leveraging GPU capabilities, products can handle more complex AI tasks without a significant increase in cost. This knowledge could lead to better resource allocation and improved user experiences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the host-device paradigm allows CPUs to coordinate tasks while GPUs execute parallel computations. This setup is particularly advantageous for AI training, as GPUs can process thousands of operations simultaneously. However, engineers must also consider memory bandwidth and data transfer times between the CPU and GPU to ensure optimal performance."
