Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.",

  "speedrun": "A recent workshop highlighted the growing connection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, coining the term 'NeuroAI.' This approach could enhance AI algorithms by incorporating insights from how biological brains function. Researchers emphasized areas like embodiment, language, and robotics as key focus points. Understanding this synergy is crucial now, as it may lead to more efficient AI systems that mimic human learning and communication.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "NeuroAI could improve AI applications for healthcare professionals, enhancing diagnostics and treatment strategies through better understanding of human cognition.",
    "This trend indicates a broader shift in AI development, moving towards more biologically-inspired models that could reshape industries reliant on intelligent systems."

    "eli12": "NeuroAI is like teaching a robot to think more like a human by using insights from brain science. This could help machines learn and communicate better. For everyday people, this means smarter technology that understands us more intuitively, making our interactions with devices smoother and more effective.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, NeuroAI represents an opportunity to create more user-friendly AI products. By integrating neuroscience principles, these products could better meet user needs and reduce costs in development. This shift could lead to more intuitive interfaces and smarter features that enhance user engagement.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, NeuroAI leverages insights from neuroscience to optimize AI algorithms, particularly in areas like neuromorphic engineering. This could lead to models that more closely mimic human learning processes, enhancing efficiency and performance. However, careful consideration of the strengths and weaknesses outlined in SWOT analyses is essential to navigate potential risks."
