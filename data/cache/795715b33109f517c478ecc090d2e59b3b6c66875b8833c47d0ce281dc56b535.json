  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.22290v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities yet remain fundamentally probabilistic, presenting critical reliability challenges for enterprise deployment. We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.",

  "speedrun": "The Six Sigma Agent introduces a new architecture to enhance the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enterprise use. It achieves this through task decomposition, parallel execution across multiple agents, and consensus voting. Notably, using cheaper models with a 5% error rate, the system reduces errors to just 0.11% with 5 agents. This matters now as businesses increasingly rely on AI systems, necessitating reliable solutions that can perform consistently in real-world applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses looking for dependable AI tools can significantly reduce error rates, enhancing operational efficiency and trust in technology.",
    "This approach signals a shift in AI reliability strategies, emphasizing redundancy and consensus rather than merely improving model size."

    "eli12": "The Six Sigma Agent is like a team of experts tackling a problem together instead of relying on just one. By breaking tasks down and having multiple agents provide their answers, the system ensures more accurate results. This matters to everyday people because it means AI can be more reliable in areas like customer service or healthcare, where mistakes can have serious consequences.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the Six Sigma Agent highlights a way to meet user needs for reliability without high costs. By utilizing multiple lower-cost models and achieving significant error reduction, teams can enhance product performance while saving resources. This could lead to more trust in AI-driven products and better user experiences.",
    "engineer": "The Six Sigma Agent employs a method where tasks are broken down into atomic actions, executed across multiple LLMs to gather diverse outputs. With an error rate of 5%, using 5 agents results in an impressive reduction to 0.11% error. This architecture shows that reliability can be improved through consensus and redundancy, challenging the notion that only larger models can deliver dependable performance."
