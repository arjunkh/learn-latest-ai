  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.06161v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition whose rising prevalence places increasing demands on a lengthy diagnostic process. Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics.",

  "speedrun": "A new study compares machine learning methods for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using clinical notes. It introduces a transparent model based on BioBERT that achieved 97% sensitivity and 98% specificity when trained on mixed datasets. In contrast, a traditional black-box model only reached 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity. This research highlights the potential for more reliable AI tools in diagnosing neurodevelopmental conditions, addressing the growing demand for efficient diagnostic processes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Clinicians could benefit from more accurate and interpretable diagnostic tools, which may reduce the time needed for ASD diagnosis.",
    "As AI tools become more transparent, they could reshape the market for medical diagnostics, promoting trust and wider adoption in healthcare."

    "eli12": "This study shows how AI can help diagnose autism by analyzing clinical notes. The researchers used a special model that understands medical language, achieving high accuracy. Think of it like a smart assistant that reads through patient notes to find signs of autism. This matters because it could make diagnosing autism faster and more reliable for doctors and families.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study highlights a user need for more trustworthy diagnostic tools in healthcare. The transparent model not only improves accuracy but could also reduce costs associated with lengthy diagnostic processes. A practical implication is that developing AI solutions that prioritize interpretability could lead to better user adoption in clinical settings.",
    "engineer": "The study utilized BioBERT, a language model, to analyze clinical notes and label behaviors linked to autism. The transparent model achieved 97% sensitivity and 98% specificity with mixed data training, outperforming the black-box model, which had 90% sensitivity. This emphasizes the importance of transfer learning and dataset mixing, showing that training strategies significantly impact model performance."
