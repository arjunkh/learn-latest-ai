    "eli12": "Stepwise selection is like cleaning out your closetâ€”keeping only the clothes you wear most often. This technique helps simplify regression models by focusing on the most important factors. For everyday people, it means that data-driven decisions can be made faster and with more accuracy.",
    "pm": "For product managers, using stepwise selection can enhance user experience by ensuring that only the most relevant features are considered. This can lead to cost savings in development and more efficient use of resources. It highlights the importance of focusing on user needs while optimizing product offerings.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, stepwise selection applies algorithms that systematically add or remove variables based on their statistical significance. This method can improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting. Implementing this in Python provides a practical way to handle real-world datasets effectively."
