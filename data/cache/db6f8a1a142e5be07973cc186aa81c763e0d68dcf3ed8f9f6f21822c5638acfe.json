  "speedrun": "A new eBook reveals that while the emissions from single AI queries—like text, images, or videos—appear minimal, the cumulative impact is significant. It emphasizes that the industry is not fully accounting for these emissions, raising concerns about future growth. This matters now as AI continues to expand, potentially leading to a larger carbon footprint that could affect climate goals.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "AI developers and users could face increased scrutiny and pressure to mitigate emissions, impacting operational choices.",
    "This highlights a broader trend where sustainability is becoming crucial in tech industries, influencing investment and regulatory landscapes."

    "eli12": "This eBook explains how the energy used by AI might seem small at first, like a single drop in an ocean. But, when you consider all the AI queries together, it adds up to a big wave of emissions. It’s important for everyday people because it shows how our tech habits could impact the environment.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this insight into AI's energy footprint highlights a growing user need for sustainable solutions. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, integrating energy-efficient practices could improve brand loyalty and reduce costs in the long run.",
    "engineer": "The eBook discusses the cumulative emissions from AI queries, emphasizing that while individual queries might generate low emissions, the total impact is significant. This raises questions about the models used for estimating emissions and the need for better tracking methods as AI technology evolves."
