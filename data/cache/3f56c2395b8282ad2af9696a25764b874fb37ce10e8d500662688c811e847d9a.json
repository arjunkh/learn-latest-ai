    "eli12": "AI and quantum technologies are changing the game in cybersecurity. Imagine a race where attackers have faster cars; they can reach their destination before defenders can react. This shift is important for everyone because it means our online safety measures need to keep pace with these new threats.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of AI in cyberattacks highlights a critical user need for robust security features. As attackers become more efficient, investing in advanced cybersecurity can enhance user trust and protect sensitive data. This could lead to new product opportunities focused on innovative security solutions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AI tools enable attackers to automate processes like reconnaissance and ransomware deployment, increasing their effectiveness. This evolution necessitates the development of advanced defenses that can operate at a similar speed and scale. Engineers must consider integrating AI-driven security measures to counter these evolving threats."
