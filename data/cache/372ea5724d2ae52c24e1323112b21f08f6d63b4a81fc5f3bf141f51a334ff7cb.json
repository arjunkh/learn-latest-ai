  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers and teams may face increased confusion and technical debt if prompts are mixed with code, hindering productivity.",
    "In the long run, maintaining a clean codebase can enhance collaboration and streamline workflows, offering a competitive edge."

    "eli12": "Think of your code like a kitchen. Mixing your shopping list (prompts) with your recipes (code) can make it hard to find what you need. Keeping them separate helps you cook faster and easier. This matters for everyday folks because clearer projects lead to better apps and tools we all use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this means prioritizing a clean project structure. Keeping prompts separate can improve team collaboration and speed up development. A practical next step is to establish guidelines for managing prompts outside of code repositories.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, separating prompts from code can reduce clutter and improve maintainability. This approach helps in tracking changes and understanding project structure better. However, it requires discipline in managing files and might slow down initial development if not implemented thoughtfully."
