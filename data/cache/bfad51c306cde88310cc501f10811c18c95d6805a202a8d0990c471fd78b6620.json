  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.17643v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.",

  "speedrun": "A new study explores how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the pix2pix model, can autonomously learn topological relationships in architectural design. By adding Grasshopper-based detection modules, researchers demonstrated that this approach can efficiently detect and visualize learning processes. This is significant because it could streamline architectural design by minimizing information loss during data conversion, making it easier for architects to incorporate regional characteristics into their work.",

    "Architects could benefit from more efficient design tools, allowing for better integration of spatial characteristics in their projects.",
    "This research suggests a shift towards more autonomous design processes, potentially reshaping how urban renewal projects utilize AI."

    "eli12": "This study shows how AI can learn to recognize important patterns in architecture, much like how a student learns to identify key features in different buildings. By improving how these patterns are detected, architects could create designs that better reflect their surroundings. This matters because it could lead to buildings that are more in harmony with their environment.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a user need for efficient tools in architectural design. By leveraging the improved capabilities of pix2pix, companies could reduce costs and time spent on design iterations. The practical implication is that integrating these detection modules could enhance product offerings in the architectural software market.",
    "engineer": "The study focuses on enhancing the pix2pix model by integrating Grasshopper-based detection modules to assess its ability to learn spatial topologies. It provides quantitative data showing how different input modes, like greyscale and RGB, influence learning efficiency. This approach could improve the performance of image-based GANs in recognizing and applying topological structures, though the study emphasizes the need for streamlined tools to minimize information loss."
