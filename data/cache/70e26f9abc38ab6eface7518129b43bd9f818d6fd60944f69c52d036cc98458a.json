    "eli12": "Think of training a robot like teaching a child to walk. Using 3D simulations means the robot can practice falling and getting back up without any real-world consequences. This matters because it could lead to robots that can navigate our homes and workplaces more effectively, making our lives easier.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a growing user need for more adaptable robots. By utilizing advanced simulations, companies could reduce costs associated with physical prototypes and speed up the training process. This could lead to quicker iterations and a more efficient product development cycle.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, using MuJoCo and Gym for Reinforcement Learning allows for high-fidelity physics simulations, which can significantly improve the training of humanoid robots. These platforms provide a robust environment for testing algorithms that can lead to better performance benchmarks in real-world applications. However, engineers should be aware of the computational demands that come with such detailed simulations."
