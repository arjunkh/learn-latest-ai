  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.10660v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed a method called ZapGPT that allows simple agents to be guided by natural language prompts in controlling simulated cellular behavior. This approach uses one AI model to interpret commands and another to evaluate the results, enabling the system to adapt and improve without rigid programming. The breakthrough is significant because it shows that language can serve as a control mechanism, paving the way for more intuitive interactions with complex systems.",

    "eli12": "ZapGPT is like teaching a pet new tricks using simple words instead of complicated commands. It lets agents understand and respond to natural language, making interactions smoother and more intuitive. This matters because it could lead to everyday technology that responds to our spoken instructions just like a friend would.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ZapGPT highlights a growing user need for systems that can be controlled with natural language instead of technical commands. This could reduce development costs and improve efficiency by minimizing the need for specialized programming. A practical implication is that products could become more accessible to non-experts, broadening their user base.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, ZapGPT demonstrates a novel approach where one AI model translates language prompts into actions, while another assesses the outcomes. This method allows for generalization to new prompts without retraining, marking a departure from traditional reliance on engineered fitness functions. The potential for language to replace rigid programming in AI and bioengineering could lead to more adaptive and versatile systems."
