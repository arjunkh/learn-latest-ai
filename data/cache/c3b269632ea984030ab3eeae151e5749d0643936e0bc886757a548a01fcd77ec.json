  "speedrun": "In the age of large language models (LLMs), researchers are blending traditional reading with AI assistance to keep up with the growing volume of academic papers. This approach combines manual reading with AI tools to summarize and extract key insights efficiently. For example, using AI to highlight essential findings could save hours of reading time. This shift matters now as the pace of research accelerates, making it crucial for scholars to stay informed without being overwhelmed.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers can quickly grasp key insights from numerous papers, enhancing their productivity and understanding.",
    "The integration of AI in academic reading signals a broader trend toward leveraging technology for efficiency in knowledge acquisition."

    "eli12": "Reading research papers can feel like drinking from a fire hose, especially with so many being published. By using AI tools to help summarize and highlight important parts, researchers can save time and focus on what really matters. This matters because it helps everyone stay updated without getting lost in too much information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend highlights a user need for efficient information processing. By utilizing AI tools, they can reduce the time spent on research, which can lead to faster decision-making. A practical implication is that teams can focus more on innovation rather than getting bogged down by excessive reading.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, leveraging LLMs for reading research papers involves using models that can summarize and extract key insights effectively. These models can handle vast amounts of text and identify critical data points, significantly enhancing research efficiency. However, it's important to ensure that the AI's interpretations are accurate and relevant."
