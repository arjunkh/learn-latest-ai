We propose a training-time interpretability view that tracks token-level attributions across finetuning epochs. We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research introduces the Reasoning Stabilization Point (RSP), a metric that helps track how a language model's reliance on evidence changes during fine-tuning. By measuring 'explanation drift,' the study shows that models often stabilize early in training while validation accuracy continues to improve. This finding is significant because it offers a way to monitor model behavior without needing additional data, enhancing interpretability in AI development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could help developers identify when a model becomes reliable, providing clearer insights during training. It streamlines the fine-tuning process, making it easier to manage.",
    "The broader implication is that as AI models become more interpretable, they could gain trust and acceptance in industries requiring high reliability, like healthcare or finance."

    "eli12": "The Reasoning Stabilization Point (RSP) is like finding the sweet spot in cooking; it tells you when a dish is just right. In AI, it shows when a model's decision-making becomes stable after training. This matters to everyone because it means we can trust AI systems to make better decisions without constantly needing new data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding RSP could streamline the fine-tuning process, allowing for quicker iterations on AI models. It highlights the need for balancing model performance and interpretability, ensuring users can trust the outcomes. This could lead to more efficient resource allocation during product development.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the RSP provides a way to measure 'explanation drift'—the changes in token attributions during training. The study shows that for several lightweight transformer classifiers, drift stabilizes early, indicating a reliable decision-making phase. This insight allows engineers to select optimal checkpoints without additional tuning, simplifying the development process."
