Think of it like getting car insurance; it makes you feel more secure on the road. This matters because as more companies use AI, knowing they have some protection can encourage them to take the plunge.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ElevenLabs' insurance for AI agents highlights a new user need: risk management in AI adoption. This could improve customer confidence, making it easier to sell AI products. However, they should consider how to communicate the actual limits of this insurance to avoid misleading clients.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, ElevenLabs' move to insure its AI agents signals a commitment to reliability and safety in AI deployment. While specific benchmarks or models weren't detailed, the initiative suggests a focus on minimizing risks associated with AI errors. Engineers should be aware that insurance may not cover all potential failures, emphasizing the importance of robust system design."
