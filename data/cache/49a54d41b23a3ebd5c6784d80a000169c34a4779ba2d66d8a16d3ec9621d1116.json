    "eli12": "Industry 5.0 is like a symphony, where different instruments (like AI and robotics) work together to create beautiful music. This approach focuses on how technology can support and enhance human work, rather than just replacing it. It matters because it could lead to better jobs and more meaningful work for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Industry 5.0 emphasizes the need to create solutions that enhance human capabilities rather than just automate tasks. This could lead to more user-friendly products that improve collaboration between people and machines. A practical implication is the opportunity to design features that support teamwork and creativity.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Industry 5.0 involves orchestrating AI, IoT, and robotics to work in harmony, rather than just integrating them. This could mean developing systems that allow for real-time data sharing and decision-making across platforms. Engineers might focus on optimizing these interactions to improve efficiency and user experience."
