  "speedrun": "The role of embryologists is evolving as demand for in vitro fertilization (IVF) grows. With more people seeking fertility treatments, these specialists are now handling an increased workload. As a result, the field is seeing a shift toward incorporating AI technologies to streamline processes and improve outcomes. This change is significant as it could enhance efficiency and success rates in IVF treatments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Patients seeking fertility treatments may experience shorter wait times and improved success rates due to AI's efficiency in embryo selection.",
    "The integration of AI in IVF could signify a broader trend in healthcare, where technology increasingly supports specialized medical roles."

    "eli12": "Embryologists help with in vitro fertilization, which is when embryos are created outside the body. As more people look for help with fertility, these scientists are getting busier. They might start using AI to make their work easier and more effective. This matters because it could lead to better outcomes for families trying to conceive.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the increasing reliance on AI in embryology highlights a growing user need for efficient fertility solutions. By developing tools that assist embryologists, companies could reduce costs and improve the IVF process. This shift could lead to innovative products that meet the demands of a changing market.",
    "engineer": "The integration of AI in embryology could involve machine learning models that analyze embryo quality and predict success rates. With the rising demand for IVF, these technologies could optimize the selection process, potentially increasing success rates beyond current benchmarks. However, the effectiveness of these models will depend on the quality of data and algorithms used."
