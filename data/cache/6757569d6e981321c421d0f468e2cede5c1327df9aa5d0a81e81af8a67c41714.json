    "eli12": "Imagine trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is growing every day. U.S. investigators are using AI to spot harmful images of children that are being created more frequently. This matters because it helps keep kids safe from online predators and holds those who create such content accountable.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this situation highlights a critical user need for safety tools in digital platforms. The integration of AI for detecting harmful content could enhance user trust and engagement, potentially leading to increased usage. This also emphasizes the importance of building ethical AI systems that prioritize user protection.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the application of AI in detecting child abuse images involves advanced image recognition algorithms trained on vast datasets. These models must be precise, as false positives could lead to significant consequences. The challenge lies in balancing detection accuracy with the ethical implications of monitoring sensitive content."
