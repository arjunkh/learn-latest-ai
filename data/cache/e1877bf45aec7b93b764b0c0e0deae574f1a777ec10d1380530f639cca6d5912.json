  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.22269v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.",

  "speedrun": "The JAF: Judge Agent Forest framework introduces a new way for AI systems to evaluate their own reasoning. Instead of assessing responses individually, JAF allows a judge agent to analyze multiple responses together, identifying patterns and inconsistencies. This holistic approach enhances the AI's ability to refine its outputs. As AI becomes more integrated into decision-making, frameworks like JAF could significantly improve the reliability of AI-generated solutions.",

    "This could lead to more accurate AI responses, benefiting developers and users who rely on AI for critical evaluations.",
    "The development indicates a shift toward more collaborative and efficient AI systems, potentially transforming how AI interacts with complex data."

    "eli12": "JAF acts like a group study session for AI, where the judge agent learns from comparing multiple answers instead of just one. This method helps the AI understand its mistakes better and improve future responses. For everyday people, this means AI tools might become more reliable and helpful in solving problems.",
    "pm": "For product managers, JAF could enhance user experience by providing more accurate AI outputs through collective evaluation. This approach may reduce costs associated with error correction and improve efficiency in AI-driven tasks. Implementing such frameworks could lead to more robust and user-friendly AI applications.",
    "engineer": "JAF employs a locality-sensitive hashing algorithm to optimize the selection of peer responses, integrating semantic embeddings and categorical labels. This method enhances the AI's ability to learn from related examples, improving its reasoning capabilities. The empirical study on cloud misconfigurations validates JAF's effectiveness in real-world scenarios."
