  "raw_body": "Agent memory remains a problem that enterprises want to fix, as agents forget some instructions or conversations the longer they run. \nAnthropic believes it has solved this issue for its Claude Agent SDK, developing a two-fold solution that allows an agent to work across different context windows.\n“The core challenge of long-running agents is that they must work in discrete sessions, and each new session begins with no memory of what came before,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. “Because context windows are limited, and because most complex projects cannot be completed within a single window, agents need a way to bridge the gap between coding sessions.”\nAnthropic engineers proposed a two-fold approach for its Agent SDK: An initializer agent to set up the environment, and a coding agent to make incremental progress in each session and leave artifacts for the next.  \nThe agent memory problem\nSince agents are built on foundation models, they remain constrained by the limited, although continually growing, context windows. For long-running agents, this could create a larger problem, leading the agent to forget instructions and behave abnormally while performing a task. Enhancing agent memory becomes essential for consistent, business-safe performance. \nSeveral methods emerged over the past year, all attempting to bridge the gap between context windows and agent memory. LangChain’s LangMem SDK, Memobase and OpenAI’s Swarm are examples of companies offering memory solutions. Research on agentic memory has also exploded recently, with proposed frameworks like Memp and the Nested Learning Paradigm from Google offering new alternatives to enhance memory. \nMany of the current memory frameworks are open source and can ideally adapt to different large language models (LLMs) powering agents. Anthropic’s approach improves its Claude Agent SDK. \nHow it works\nAnthropic identified that even though the Claude Agent SDK had context management capabilities and “should be possible for an agent to continue to do useful work for an arbitrarily long time,” it was not sufficient. The company said in its blog post that a model like Opus 4.5 running the Claude Agent SDK can “fall short of building a production-quality web app if it’s only given a high-level prompt, such as 'build a clone of claude.ai.'” \nThe failures manifested in two patterns, Anthropic said. First, the agent tried to do too much, causing the model to run out of context in the middle. The agent then has to guess what happened and cannot pass clear instructions to the next agent. The second failure occurs later on, after some features have already been built. The agent sees progress has been made and just declares the job done. \nAnthropic researchers broke down the solution: Setting up an initial environment to lay the foundation for features and prompting each agent to make incremental progress towards a goal, while still leaving a clean slate at the end. \nThis is where the two-part solution of Anthropic's agent comes in. The initializer agent sets up the environment, logging what agents have done and which files have been added. The coding agent will then ask models to make incremental progress and leave structured updates. \n“Inspiration for these practices came from knowing what effective software engineers do every day,” Anthropic said. \nThe researchers said they added testing tools to the coding agent, improving its ability to identify and fix bugs that weren’t obvious from the code alone. \nFuture research\nAnthropic noted that its approach is “one possible set of solutions in a long-running agent harness.” However, this is just the beginning stage of what could become a wider research area for many in the AI space. \nThe company said its experiments to boost long-term memory for agents haven’t shown whether a single general-purpose coding agent works best across contexts or a multi-agent structure. \nIts demo also focused on full-stack web app development, so other experiments should focus on generalizing the results across different tasks.\n“It’s likely that some or all of these lessons can be applied to the types of long-running agentic tasks required in, for example, scientific research or financial modeling,” Anthropic said.",

  "speedrun": "Anthropic has introduced a new solution for AI agents that addresses a long-standing issue of memory loss during extended tasks. Their Claude Agent SDK employs a two-part method, featuring an initializer agent to set up the environment and a coding agent to make incremental progress. This approach aims to allow agents to retain context and improve performance over multiple sessions. This development is significant as it could enhance the reliability of AI agents in complex projects, making them more effective for businesses.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Enterprises relying on AI agents will benefit from improved memory, leading to more consistent and reliable outputs across tasks.",
    "This innovation could signify a broader shift in AI development, focusing on enhancing agent memory and performance in complex environments."

    "eli12": "Anthropic has created a new way for AI agents to remember things better over time. By using two types of agents—one to set up tasks and another to carry them out—these agents can work on projects without forgetting important details. Think of it as having a teammate who keeps notes while you work together. This matters because it could make AI assistants much more useful in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Anthropic's new SDK could address a key user need for reliable AI performance in long-term projects. By improving agent memory, teams could see increased efficiency and fewer errors in task execution. This might allow for smoother project workflows, reducing the need for constant oversight and corrections.",
    "engineer": "Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK introduces a two-part system to tackle the agent memory problem. The initializer agent sets up the context, while the coding agent makes incremental updates, logging progress. This approach aims to reduce failures where agents forget instructions or prematurely declare tasks complete. Though promising, further research is needed to determine the best structure for long-running tasks across various applications."
