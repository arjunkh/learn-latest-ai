  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.21720v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques. Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques to function as an interactive \"Personality Brain.\" Finally, the entire suite of predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust, scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing, showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach, demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.",
