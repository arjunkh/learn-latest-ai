    "eli12": "Imagine trying to describe a color to someone who’s never seen it. Measuring pain is similar; it’s subjective and hard to articulate. This new app could help people express their pain more clearly, making it easier for doctors to help. This matters because better pain management can lead to a healthier, happier life for many.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this app addresses a significant user need: accurate pain assessment. By leveraging AI, it could reduce the time and effort required for patients to communicate their pain levels. This efficiency could enhance patient satisfaction and lead to better healthcare outcomes.",
    "engineer": "The app employs machine learning algorithms to interpret user input regarding pain levels. By analyzing patterns in responses, it can provide insights that may not be immediately obvious. This approach could lead to more precise pain assessments, although the effectiveness will depend on the quality of data collected."
