  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.23734v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity. Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity, certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific pursuit.",

  "speedrun": "A recent paper explores how AI impacts creativity in scientific fields, particularly through the lens of disciplinary creativity, which is the application of specialized knowledge to solve problems. The study highlights that while AI can enhance creativity, it may also overshadow it in some cases. For instance, in mathematics, AI's computational abilities can extend creative solutions but might also diminish the value of traditional scientific inquiry. This discussion is crucial as the integration of AI in research continues to evolve.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and scientists may need to adapt their approaches as AI tools reshape problem-solving in their fields.",
    "This shift could signal a broader trend where reliance on AI alters the perception and value of human creativity in various disciplines."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI changes the way scientists think creatively about problems. It shows that while AI can help generate new ideas, it might also take away from the unique insights that human experts bring. Imagine a painter using a machine to create art; while it can produce beautiful pieces, it might lessen the personal touch that makes art special. Understanding this balance is important for everyone, as it affects how we value creativity.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the need to consider how AI tools can both enhance and potentially replace human creativity. There's a user need for products that support creative processes without overshadowing the unique insights of experts. This means developing AI that complements rather than competes with human skills, which could lead to more effective and innovative solutions in the market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the paper discusses how AI can extend creative capabilities in scientific problem-solving, particularly in mathematics. It emphasizes that while AI's computational power can generate new solutions, it may also displace traditional methods of inquiry. This duality suggests a need for engineers to design AI systems that enhance rather than replace the nuanced thinking of human experts, ensuring that the value of disciplinary creativity remains intact."
