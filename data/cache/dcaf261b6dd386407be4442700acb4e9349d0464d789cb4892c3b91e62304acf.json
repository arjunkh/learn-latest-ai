    "eli12": "Building a memory layer for LLMs is like giving your favorite book a bookmark that remembers where you left off. This means the AI can recall past conversations or facts, making it smarter and more helpful. For everyday people, this could mean better responses from AI assistants, tailored just for you.",
    "pm": "For product managers, creating a custom memory layer addresses user needs for more relevant and context-aware interactions. It could reduce repetitive queries, improving user satisfaction. This development may also lower costs associated with data processing by streamlining information retrieval.",
    "engineer": "The guide outlines the technical steps to implement a memory layer in LLMs, focusing on autonomous retrieval systems. Key specifics include optimizing data structures for efficient access and integrating them with existing LLM architectures. This could enhance performance metrics, although careful consideration of data privacy is essential."
