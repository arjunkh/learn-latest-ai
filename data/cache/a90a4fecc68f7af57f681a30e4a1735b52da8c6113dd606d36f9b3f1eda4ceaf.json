    "eli12": "AWS Bedrock is like a toolbox for developers, providing them with ready-to-use AI models. Instead of building everything from scratch, they can pick and customize models that fit their needs. This is important because it allows more people to use AI, potentially improving everyday tasks and services.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, AWS Bedrock offers a way to integrate AI without heavy investment in machine learning expertise. It could lower costs and increase efficiency by enabling faster development of AI-driven features. This means teams can focus on user experience rather than backend complexities.",
    "engineer": "AWS Bedrock provides access to various foundational models, allowing for customization and deployment of LLMs with reduced technical overhead. By leveraging these pre-trained models, developers can achieve significant efficiency gains in building AI applications. However, it's essential to consider model performance and suitability for specific tasks."
