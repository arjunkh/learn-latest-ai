    "eli12": "Understanding why customers stop buying is key for businesses. By looking at transaction trends, companies can see early signs of trouble, like a small dip in purchases. This is like noticing a plant wilting before it dies; catching it early allows for intervention. For everyday people, this means companies might reach out with offers or support before they lose a customer.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, recognizing early signs of customer churn is crucial. By analyzing transaction trends, they can identify users at risk of leaving and tailor retention strategies accordingly. This approach could lead to more efficient use of resources, as addressing small issues early may prevent larger losses. It emphasizes the need for data-driven decision-making in customer engagement.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this method employs regression analysis to quantify customer purchase behavior over time. By converting regression slopes into degrees, it provides a clearer visualization of trends. A small negative slope can be a critical indicator of potential churn, allowing for timely interventions. This approach underscores the importance of data analytics in predicting customer behavior."
