  "speedrun": "In 2025, extreme heat waves caused power outages across North America, Europe, and the Middle East, highlighting the strain of rising temperatures on energy grids. A promising solution lies in radiative cooling, which uses specially designed paints and coatings to reflect heat away from buildings, reducing reliance on air conditioning. This ancient concept, enhanced by modern technology, could significantly lower energy consumption. As global temperatures rise, finding effective cooling solutions is crucial for sustainable living.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Homeowners and businesses could benefit from reduced energy costs and improved comfort through innovative cooling solutions.",
    "This trend may signal a shift towards sustainable building practices, influencing the construction and materials market significantly."

    "eli12": "Imagine a special paint that helps keep your house cool by reflecting sunlight. This is what radiative cooling does, using modern technology to enhance an old idea. As summers get hotter, this could help people save on energy bills and stay comfortable, making it important for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the rise of radiative cooling paints presents a new market opportunity. Users increasingly seek energy-efficient solutions to combat rising temperatures. By focusing on cost-effective and sustainable products, businesses could meet this growing demand while enhancing their brand's reputation.",
    "engineer": "Radiative cooling employs materials that reflect infrared radiation, effectively lowering surface temperatures. Recent advancements have improved the efficiency of these coatings, allowing for significant energy savings. However, the effectiveness can vary based on environmental conditions, which is an important consideration for deployment."
