Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research explores how small-world (SW) networks can improve multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs). By adapting SW connectivity, which balances local and long-range communication, the study found that it maintains accuracy while stabilizing consensus among agents. This approach introduces a method to adaptively connect agents based on their uncertainty, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of MAS. Understanding these dynamics could reshape how we design collaborative AI systems.",

    "eli12": "This research shows how connecting AI agents like friends in a neighborhood can help them work better together. By using small-world networks, agents can quickly share ideas while still having deep discussions. This could make AI systems smarter and more reliable, which matters for everyday tasks like customer service or personal assistants.",
