  "raw_body": "Google AI Studio has gotten a big vibe coding upgrade with a new interface, buttons, suggestions and community features that allow anyone with an idea for an app — even complete novices, laypeople, or non-developers like yours truly — to bring it into existence and deploy it live, on the web, for anyone to use, within minutes.\nThe updated Build tab is available now at ai.studio/build, and it’s free to start. \nUsers can experiment with building applications without needing to enter payment information upfront, though certain advanced features like Veo 3.1 and Cloud Run deployment require a paid API key.\nThe new features appear to me to make Google's AI models and offerings even more competitive, perhaps preferred, for many general users to dedicated AI startup rivals like Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex, respectively, two \"vibe coding\" focused products that are beloved by developers — but seem to have a higher barrier to entry or may require more technical know-how.\nA Fresh Start: Redesigned Build Mode\nThe updated Build tab serves as the entry point to vibe coding. It introduces a new layout and workflow where users can select from Google’s suite of AI models and features to power their applications. The default is Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is great for most cases.\nOnce selections are made, users simply describe what they want to build, and the system automatically assembles the necessary components using Gemini’s APIs.\nThis mode supports mixing capabilities like Nano Banana (a lightweight AI model), Veo (for video understanding), Imagine (for image generation), Flashlight (for performance-optimized inference), and Google Search.\nPatrick Löber, Developer Relations at Google DeepMind, highlighted that the experience is meant to help users “supercharge your apps with AI” using a simple prompt-to-app pipeline.\nIn a video demo he posted on X and LinedIn, he showed how just a few clicks led to the automatic generation of a garden planning assistant app, complete with layouts, visuals, and a conversational interface.\n\nFrom Prompt to Production: Building and Editing in Real Time\nOnce an app is generated, users land in a fully interactive editor. On the left, there’s a traditional code-assist interface where developers can chat with the AI model for help or suggestions. On the right, a code editor displays the full source of the app.\nEach component—such as React entry points, API calls, or styling files—can be edited directly. Tooltips help users understand what each file does, which is especially useful for those less familiar with TypeScript or frontend frameworks.\nApps can be saved to GitHub, downloaded locally, or shared directly. Deployment is possible within the Studio environment or via Cloud Run if advanced scaling or hosting is needed.\nInspiration on Demand: The ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ Button\nOne standout feature in this update is the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Designed for users who need a creative jumpstart, it generates randomized app concepts and configures the app setup accordingly. Each press yields a different idea, complete with suggested AI features and components.\nExamples produced during demos include:\n\nAn interactive map-based chatbot powered by Google Search and conversational AI.\n\nA dream garden designer using image generation and advanced planning tools.\n\nA trivia game app with an AI host whose personality users can define, integrating both Imagine and Flashlight with Gemini 2.5 Pro for conversation and reasoning.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick, Lead of Product for Google AI Studio and Gemini AI, noted in a demo video of his own that this feature encourages discovery and experimentation. \n“You get some really, really cool, different experiences,” he said, emphasizing its role in helping users find novel ideas quickly.\n\nHands-On Test: From Prompt to App in 65 Seconds\nTo test the new workflow, I prompted Gemini with:\nA randomized dice rolling web application where the user can select between common dice sizes (6 sides, 10 sides, etc) and then see an animated die rolling and choose the color of their die as well.\nWithin 65 seconds (just over a minute) AI Studio returned a fully working web app featuring:\n\nDice size selector (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)\n\nColor customization options for the die\n\nAnimated rolling effect with randomized results\n\nClean, modern UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS\n\nThe platform also generated a complete set of structured files, including App.tsx, constants.ts, and separate components for dice logic and controls. \nAfter generation, it was easy to iterate: adding sound effects for each interaction (rolling, choosing a die, changing color) required only a single follow-up prompt to the built-in assistant. This was also suggested by Gemini, too, by the way. \nFrom there, the app can be previewed live or exported using built-in controls to:\n\nSave to GitHub\n\nDownload the full codebase\n\nCopy the project for remixing\n\nDeploy via integrated tools\n\nMy brief, hands-on test showed just how quickly even small utility apps can go from idea to interactive prototype—without leaving the browser or writing boilerplate code manually.\nAI-Suggested Enhancements and Feature Refinement\nIn addition to code generation, Google AI Studio now offers context-aware feature suggestions. These recommendations, generated by Gemini’s Flashlight capability, analyze the current app and propose relevant improvements.\nIn one example, the system suggested implementing a feature that displays the history of previously generated images in an image studio tab. These iterative enhancements allow builders to expand app functionality over time without starting from scratch.\nKilpatrick emphasized that users can continue to refine their projects as they go, combining both automatic generation and manual adjustments. “You can go in and continue to edit and sort of refine the experience that you want iteratively,” he said.\nFree to Start, Flexible to Grow\nThe new experience is available at no cost for users who want to experiment, prototype, or build lightweight apps. There’s no requirement to enter credit card information to begin using vibe coding.\nHowever, more powerful capabilities — such as using models like Veo 3.1 or deploying through Cloud Run — do require switching to a paid API key.\nThis pricing structure is intended to lower the barrier to entry for experimentation while providing a clear path to scale when needed.\nBuilt for All Skill Levels\nOne of the central goals of the vibe coding launch is to make AI app development accessible to more people. The system supports both high-level visual builders and low-level code editing, creating a workflow that works for developers across experience levels.\nKilpatrick mentioned that while he’s more familiar with Python than TypeScript, he still found the editor useful because of the helpful file descriptions and intuitive layout. \nThis focus on usability could make AI Studio a compelling option for developers exploring AI for the first time.\nMore to Come: A Week of Launches\nThe launch of vibe coding is the first in a series of announcements expected throughout the week. While specific future features haven’t been revealed yet, both Kilpatrick and Löber hinted that additional updates are on the way.\nWith this update, Google AI Studio positions itself as a flexible, user-friendly environment for building AI-powered applications—whether for fun, prototyping, or production deployment. The focus is clear: make the power of Gemini’s APIs accessible without unnecessary complexity.",
