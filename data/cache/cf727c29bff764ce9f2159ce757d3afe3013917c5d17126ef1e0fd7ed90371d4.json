  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.",

  "speedrun": "A new study proposes enhancing AI model evaluations by incorporating human-derived criteria, particularly in physical world modeling. Researchers identified key cognitive skills—like Prioritization and Contextualizing—through interviews and surveys. They found that while people expect high performance from AI, they perceive it as lacking interpretive and empathetic skills. This approach aims to make AI evaluations more relatable and aligned with human reasoning, which is crucial as AI continues to evolve.",

    "eli12": "This study suggests that traditional ways of measuring AI might miss important human-like skills. By adding criteria based on how people think, the aim is to make AI more understandable and relatable. This matters because as AI becomes more integrated into our lives, we want it to act in ways that make sense to us.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this approach highlights the importance of user expectations in AI development. By focusing on cognitive skills, teams could create AI that resonates better with users, potentially reducing frustration and increasing adoption. This could lead to more efficient designs and a stronger market presence.",
    "engineer": "The study emphasizes the need to augment traditional benchmarks like Perception Test and OpenEQA with human-derived criteria. Key cognitive skills identified, such as Discerning and Contextualizing, could help in fine-tuning AI models. This approach could enhance interpretability and applicability, making AI evaluations more aligned with human reasoning."
