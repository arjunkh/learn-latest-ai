  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.15952v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what conditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling \"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a framework designed to enhance understanding of intelligence in AI. Unlike traditional models that focus on 'what is intelligence?', SCL emphasizes 'under what conditions does cognition emerge?'. This approach operationalizes philosophical ideas into practical structures, suggesting that intelligence is more about the process of continuous understanding than mere accuracy. This matters now as it could reshape how we develop and evaluate AI systems by focusing on their cognitive architecture.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For AI developers, this could lead to more coherent and interpretable systems, enhancing user trust and engagement.",
    "On a broader scale, SCL may shift AI research from merely improving model size to refining the underlying cognitive structures, influencing future technology development."

    "eli12": "The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is like a feedback loop that helps AI understand and learn continuously. Instead of just spitting out answers, it focuses on how AI can improve its understanding over time. This is important for people because it could lead to smarter, more reliable AI that better understands our needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers, SCL highlights the need for AI systems that not only perform tasks but also understand their actions. This could lead to more efficient products that adapt to user feedback. A practical implication is that teams may prioritize developing AI with clear cognitive frameworks over simply increasing model size.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, SCL proposes a shift from monolithic systems to architectures that separate cognitive functions, which could enhance interpretability and performance. This aligns with process philosophy and enactive cognition, suggesting that intelligence is a dynamic process rather than static representation. Implementing SCL could improve how AI systems manage their own understanding and decision-making processes."
