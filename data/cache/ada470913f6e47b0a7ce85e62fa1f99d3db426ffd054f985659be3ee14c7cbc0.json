    "eli12": "Imagine a giant bonfire that not only burns but also reshapes the land around it. That's what happened in Los Angeles with the recent wildfires, which destroyed homes and lives. This situation matters because it shows how climate change is affecting our neighborhoods and what we need to do to prepare for the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this disaster highlights the need for tools that help communities assess risks and plan for recovery. Understanding user needs in disaster-prone areas can lead to solutions that provide real-time data and support. A practical next step could be developing partnerships with tech firms specializing in lidar technology.",
    "engineer": "The use of lidar technology could greatly enhance our ability to measure and visualize the damage from disasters like wildfires. However, limitations exist in terms of data accuracy and accessibility, especially in remote areas. Comparing lidar to traditional surveying methods, it offers more detailed insights but may require substantial investment and training."
