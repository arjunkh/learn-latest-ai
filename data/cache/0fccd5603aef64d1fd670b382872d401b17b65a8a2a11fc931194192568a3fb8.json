  "raw_body": "As agentic AI moves from experiments to real production workloads, a quiet but serious infrastructure problem is coming into focus: memory. Not compute. Not models. Memory.\nUnder the hood, today’s GPUs simply don’t have enough space to hold the Key-Value (KV) caches that modern, long-running AI agents depend on to maintain context. The result is a lot of invisible waste — GPUs redoing work they’ve already done, cloud costs climbing, and performance taking a hit. It’s a problem that’s already showing up in production environments, even if most people haven’t named it yet.\nAt a recent stop on the VentureBeat AI Impact Series, WEKA CTO Shimon Ben-David joined VentureBeat CEO Matt Marshall to unpack the industry’s emerging “memory wall,” and why it’s becoming one of the biggest blockers to scaling truly stateful agentic AI — systems that can remember and build on context over time. The conversation didn’t just diagnose the issue; it laid out a new way to think about memory entirely, through an approach WEKA calls token warehousing.\nThe GPU memory problem\n“When we're looking at the infrastructure of inferencing, it is not a GPU cycles challenge. It's mostly a GPU memory problem,” said Ben-David. \nThe root of the issue comes down to how transformer models work. To generate responses, they rely on KV caches that store contextual information for every token in a conversation. The longer the context window, the more memory those caches consume, and it adds up fast. A single 100,000-token sequence can require roughly 40GB of GPU memory, noted Ben-David.\nThat wouldn’t be a problem if GPUs had unlimited memory. But they don’t. Even the most advanced GPUs top out at around 288GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and that space also has to hold the model itself. \nIn real-world, multi-tenant inference environments, this becomes painful quickly. Workloads like code development or processing tax returns rely heavily on KV-cache for context. \n“If I'm loading three or four 100,000-token PDFs into a model, that's it — I've exhausted the KV cache capacity on HBM,” said Ben-David. This is what’s known as the memory wall. “Suddenly, what the inference environment is forced to do is drop data,\" he added. \nThat means GPUs are constantly throwing away context they’ll soon need again, preventing agents from being stateful and maintaining conversations and context over time\nThe hidden inference tax \n“We constantly see GPUs in inference environments recalculating things they already did,” Ben-David said. Systems prefill the KV cache, start decoding, then run out of space and evict earlier data. When that context is needed again, the whole process repeats — prefill, decode, prefill again. At scale, that’s an enormous amount of wasted work. It also means wasted energy, added latency, and degraded user experience — all while margins get squeezed.\nThat GPU recalculation waste shows up directly on the balance sheet. Organizations can suffer nearly 40% overhead just from redundant prefill cycles This is creating ripple effects in the inference market.\n“If you look at the pricing of large model providers like Anthropic and OpenAI, they are actually teaching users to structure their prompts in ways that increase the likelihood of hitting the same GPU that has their KV cache stored,” said Ben-David. “If you hit that GPU, the system can skip the prefill phase and start decoding immediately, which lets them generate more tokens efficiently.” \nBut this still doesn't solve the underlying infrastructure problem of extremely limited GPU memory capacity. \nSolving for stateful AI\n“How do you climb over that memory wall? How do you surpass it? That's the key for modern, cost- effective inferencing,” Ben-David said. “We see multiple companies trying to solve that in different ways.”\nSome organizations are deploying new linear models that try to create smaller KV caches. Others are focused on tackling cache efficiency. \n“To be more efficient, companies are using environments that calculate the KV cache on one GPU and then try to copy it from GPU memory or use a local environment for that,” Ben-David explained. “But how do you do that at scale in a cost-effective manner that doesn't strain your memory and doesn't strain your networking? That's something that WEKA is helping our customers with.”\nSimply throwing more GPUs at the problem doesn’t solve the AI memory barrier. “There are some problems that you cannot throw enough money at to solve,\" Ben-David said. \nAugmented memory and token warehousing, explained\nWEKA’s answer is what it calls augmented memory and token warehousing — a way to rethink where and how KV cache data lives. Instead of forcing everything to fit inside GPU memory, WEKA’s Augmented Memory Grid extends the KV cache into a fast, shared “warehouse” within its NeuralMesh architecture.\nIn practice, this turns memory from a hard constraint into a scalable resource — without adding inference latency. WEKA says customers see KV cache hit rates jump to 96–99% for agentic workloads, along with efficiency gains of up to 4.2x more tokens produced per GPU.\nBen-David put it simply: \"Imagine that you have 100 GPUs producing a certain amount of tokens. Now imagine that those hundred GPUs are working as if they're 420 GPUs.\"\nFor large inference providers, the result isn’t just better performance — it translates directly to real economic impact. \n“Just by adding that accelerated KV cache layer, we're looking at some use cases where the savings amount would be millions of dollars per day,” said Ben-David\nThis efficiency multiplier also opens up new strategic options for businesses. Platform teams can design stateful agents without worrying about blowing up memory budgets. Service providers can offer pricing tiers based on persistent context, with cached inference delivered at dramatically lower cost. \nWhat comes next\nNVIDIA projects a 100x increase in inference demand as agentic AI becomes the dominant workload. That pressure is already trickling down from hyperscalers to everyday enterprise deployments— this isn’t just a “big tech” problem anymore.\nAs enterprises move from proofs of concept into real production systems, memory persistence is becoming a core infrastructure concern. Organizations that treat it as an architectural priority rather than an afterthought will gain a clear advantage in both cost and performance.\nThe memory wall is not something organizations can simply outspend to overcome. As agentic AI scales, it is one of the first AI infrastructure limits that forces a deeper rethink, and as Ben-David’s insights made clear, memory may also be where the next wave of competitive differentiation begins.",
