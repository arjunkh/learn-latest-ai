  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.15959v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning, grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation, ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas. The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and regulatory sandboxes",

  "speedrun": "A new paper highlights the potential of citiverses—immersive virtual environments—for enhancing regulatory learning. It suggests using these spaces to experiment with policy scenarios, focusing on areas like transportation and urban planning. Key research areas include scalability and citizen participation. This matters now as governments and researchers seek innovative ways to adapt regulations to rapidly changing technologies and societal needs.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Policymakers could leverage citiverses to simulate and refine regulations, enhancing decision-making processes for specific sectors like urban development.",
    "This approach signals a shift towards more interactive and adaptive regulatory frameworks, potentially improving governance and public engagement across various domains."

    "eli12": "Citiverses are like virtual playgrounds for testing laws and policies. They allow experts to simulate different scenarios, helping them understand what works best. This is important for everyday people because better regulations can lead to improved services and safer environments in our communities.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, citiverses could be a new tool for understanding user needs and regulatory constraints. By testing policies in a virtual space, companies might reduce compliance costs and improve product designs. This could lead to more innovative solutions that align with evolving regulations.",
    "engineer": "The paper emphasizes using citiverses for complex modeling and real-time feedback on regulatory scenarios. Key areas include cross-border collaboration and risk reduction, which could enhance the effectiveness of regulations in diverse contexts. This approach may also integrate emerging technologies, although ethical considerations remain crucial."
