    "eli12": "Building an over-engineered retrieval system is like trying to drive a car with too many complicated gadgets. It can be frustrating and less effective than a straightforward vehicle. For everyday people, this means that simpler technology could lead to faster and more reliable results in their daily tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this article highlights the importance of understanding user needs without overcomplicating solutions. A focus on efficiency can lead to lower costs and improved user satisfaction. Simplifying retrieval systems could also enhance the overall user experience by making products more intuitive.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article points out that simpler retrieval models can sometimes yield better results than complex ones. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating performance metrics rather than getting caught up in intricate designs. This approach could lead to more efficient systems that meet user needs without unnecessary overhead."
