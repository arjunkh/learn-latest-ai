  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.21420v2 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.",

  "speedrun": "A new study focuses on three-way conflict analysis, moving beyond just understanding conflicts to finding ways to resolve them. The researchers developed algorithms to identify feasible strategies for groups of agents, using weighted measures of consistency. They applied their models to NBA labor negotiations and development plans in Gansu Province, showing that their approach outperforms traditional methods. This matters now as effective conflict resolution is crucial in various sectors, including sports and regional development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research provides practical strategies for negotiators and decision-makers facing complex conflicts, enhancing their ability to reach resolutions effectively.",
    "On a larger scale, it indicates a shift towards more systematic and data-driven approaches in conflict resolution, which could reshape how conflicts are managed across industries."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how to resolve conflicts involving multiple parties. Think of it like finding a way for three friends to agree on where to eat, considering each person's preferences. By creating strategies that balance these preferences, everyone can be happier. This matters because better conflict resolution can lead to more cooperation and less tension in everyday situations.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, this research highlights the importance of understanding diverse stakeholder needs in conflict situations. The algorithms developed can help identify optimal strategies for negotiations, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. This could lead to better outcomes in product development or partnerships, where conflicting interests often arise.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces algorithms for identifying feasible strategies in three-way conflict scenarios, focusing on weighted consistency measures. By computing overall ratings based on positive and negative similarities, the models outperform existing methods in conflict analysis. The practical applications in NBA negotiations and development planning demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms, showcasing their potential in real-world scenarios."
