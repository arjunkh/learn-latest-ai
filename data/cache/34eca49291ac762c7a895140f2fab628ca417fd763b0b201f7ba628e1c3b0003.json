  "speedrun": "Softmax Regression is an extension of Logistic Regression that allows for multiple classes. It generates a linear score for each class and normalizes these scores to produce probabilities. The core mechanics—loss, gradients, and optimization—remain unchanged. Implementing this in Excel makes the process transparent, showing how scores and probabilities evolve, which is crucial for understanding model behavior now.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data scientists can leverage this model to improve classification tasks, making it easier to interpret results in Excel.",
    "This approach highlights a growing trend toward making complex models more accessible, potentially reshaping how teams analyze data."

    "eli12": "Softmax Regression is like taking a simple recipe and adding more flavors. It builds on Logistic Regression but lets you handle multiple categories at once. By using Excel, you can watch how the model works in real-time, making it easier for anyone to grasp. This is important because it helps everyday users understand complex data decisions better.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Softmax Regression offers a way to enhance classification features in applications. It meets the user need for clear, interpretable results while keeping costs low by using familiar tools like Excel. Practically, this means teams can iterate on models more efficiently, leading to faster product improvements.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Softmax Regression maintains the same loss functions and optimization techniques as Logistic Regression, but extends its capability to multiple classes. This model computes a linear score for each class and normalizes them using the Softmax function, ensuring probabilities sum to one. The implementation in Excel allows for real-time tracking of scores and probabilities, which can aid in debugging and model improvement."
