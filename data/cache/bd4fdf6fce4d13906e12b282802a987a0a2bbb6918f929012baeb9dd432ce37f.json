    "eli12": "Ida Silfverskiöld highlights how AI agents can be more effective when using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and careful evaluation methods. Think of it like a chef who chooses the right ingredients for a dish; the choices matter more than we often realize. This is important for everyday people, as better AI could lead to smarter tools that improve our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the significance of design choices in AI systems could lead to more user-friendly products. By focusing on effective evaluation methods and RAG, they can enhance user satisfaction and reduce costs. This could mean developing AI tools that are not only powerful but also easier to use.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Silfverskiöld stresses the importance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in AI agent performance. This approach allows models to access external data sources, improving their responses. Engineers should consider how design choices in evaluation methods might impact the effectiveness of their AI systems."
