    "eli12": "This guide helps people understand how to use AI tools to find and generate information better. Think of it like having a smart assistant who not only fetches data but also checks if it makes sense. This is important because it can save time and improve the quality of information we rely on in daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this guide highlights the need for efficient data retrieval in products. By integrating LLMs, they can enhance user experiences and cut down on the time users spend searching for information. A practical implication is that investing in RAG solutions could lead to more informed users and better decision-making.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the guide discusses how LLMs can serve as evaluators in RAG systems, improving response accuracy. It suggests using specific benchmarks to measure performance, such as precision and recall rates. While the article doesn't dive deep into caveats, engineers should consider the model's limitations in various contexts."
