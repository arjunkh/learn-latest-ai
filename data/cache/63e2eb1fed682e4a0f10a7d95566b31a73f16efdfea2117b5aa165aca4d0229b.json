    "eli12": "Power Query is like a digital assistant for your Excel sheets. It helps you sort out jumbled numbers and text, making your data neat and easy to read. This matters because clean data helps everyone make better decisions, whether at work or in personal projects.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Power Query's ability to separate numbers from text addresses a common user pain point in data handling. This not only enhances user efficiency but could also lower costs related to data cleaning. A practical implication is that teams can focus more on analysis rather than spending time on data preparation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Power Query utilizes M language to manipulate data types and transform columns. By applying functions to split data, users can extract numeric and text values effectively. This feature aligns with the growing need for robust data transformation tools in analytics workflows."
