    "eli12": "Mistral's new models allow devices to convert speech into text without needing the internet. Think of it like having a personal assistant who can write down everything you say right beside you. This matters because it means better privacy and faster results for everyone, whether you're taking notes or creating captions.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Mistral's on-device models meet the growing user demand for privacy and efficiency. By reducing reliance on cloud processing, businesses could lower costs and improve user experience. This could lead to new opportunities in app development, especially in fields like education and healthcare.",
    "engineer": "Mistral's models enable on-device speech-to-text capabilities, which could enhance performance by reducing latency and improving privacy. While specific benchmarks weren't provided, this approach contrasts with traditional cloud-based models, which often face delays. Engineers should consider the implications for resource management and user experience in deploying these models."
