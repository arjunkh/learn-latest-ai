  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.16916v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.",

    "eli12": "The Hybrid Differential Reward combines two smart strategies to help self-driving cars learn better together. It's like giving them a map (the Temporal Difference Reward) and a compass (the Action Gradient Reward) to navigate traffic more effectively. This could make driving safer and more efficient for everyone, as cars learn to cooperate better on the road.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the HDR method represents a way to enhance the performance of autonomous driving technologies. By improving learning efficiency and safety, this could reduce development costs and time to market. A practical implication is that incorporating HDR could lead to more reliable autonomous systems, which is essential for gaining consumer trust.",
    "engineer": "The HDR mechanism integrates a Temporal Difference Reward based on a global potential function and an Action Gradient Reward that measures the marginal utility of actions. This dual approach addresses the low signal-to-noise ratio in traditional methods, improving convergence speed and policy stability in multi-agent settings. The framework is instantiated within a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game, showcasing its applicability in complex driving scenarios."
