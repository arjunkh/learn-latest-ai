    "eli12": "Imagine a security guard who learns from every attempted break-in, adapting their methods in real-time. That’s what adversarial learning does for AI security. It helps systems react to new threats instantly, which is vital as cyber attacks become more sophisticated. This matters to everyone because it could mean safer online experiences.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this advancement highlights a critical user need for dynamic security solutions. As AI threats grow, investing in real-time adaptive defenses could improve user trust and satisfaction. Practically, this could mean prioritizing features that incorporate adversarial learning in future product updates.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this breakthrough leverages reinforcement learning and large language models to create adaptable security measures. Unlike static defenses, these systems can respond to threats in real-time, potentially reducing response times significantly. However, the effectiveness of these models depends on continuous training and data updates to stay relevant against evolving attack strategies."
