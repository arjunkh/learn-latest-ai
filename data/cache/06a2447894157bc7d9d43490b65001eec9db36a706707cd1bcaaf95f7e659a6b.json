  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.02170v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \\textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.",

  "speedrun": "A new system called Flowchart2Mermaid converts static flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code, making them reusable and easier to modify. This tool uses advanced vision-language models to interpret flowcharts and allows users to refine their diagrams with natural language commands. With features like drag-and-drop node insertion and inline text editing, it addresses a significant gap in existing image-to-diagram tools. This innovation matters now as it enhances collaboration and efficiency in workflow design.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This tool could greatly benefit teams that rely on flowcharts for project planning, allowing for easier updates and collaboration.",
    "It signals a shift towards more interactive and editable digital tools in workflow management, enhancing productivity across various industries."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Flowchart2Mermaid is like turning a paper map into a digital one that you can easily edit. Instead of just looking at a flowchart, you can now change it on the fly and share it with others. This matters because it helps people work together more effectively and keeps everyone on the same page.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this system addresses the need for flexible and editable workflow tools. By reducing the time spent on revisions, it could lower costs and improve efficiency. A practical implication is that teams can adapt their processes quickly, leading to faster project completion.",
    "engineer": "Flowchart2Mermaid leverages vision-language models to transform flowchart images into structured Mermaid.js code. It evaluates structural accuracy, flow correctness, and syntax validity, ensuring high-quality outputs. This technical approach allows for real-time editing and version control, which is a notable advancement over previous tools."
