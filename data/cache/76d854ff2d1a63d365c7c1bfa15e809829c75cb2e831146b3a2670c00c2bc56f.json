  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.03023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

  "speedrun": "The new framework, PublicAgent, enhances access to open data for non-experts by using specialized agents for different tasks like dataset discovery and analysis. It shows that even the best models can benefit from a multi-agent approach, achieving a 97.5% win rate in agent performance. This matters now as it could democratize data analysis, making evidence-based decision-making more accessible.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Non-experts can now analyze complex datasets more easily, bridging the knowledge gap in data-driven decisions.",
    "This framework signals a shift towards more specialized AI systems, which could improve efficiency and accuracy in data analysis across various sectors."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "PublicAgent is like having a team of experts who each focus on one task, making it easier for anyone to use complex data. Instead of struggling with data alone, people can rely on these specialized agents to help them find and understand information. This could make data-driven decisions more common in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, PublicAgent highlights the need for user-friendly data tools that cater to non-experts. By employing specialized agents, products could reduce user frustration and improve decision-making speed. This means investing in features that simplify data analysis could lead to better user engagement and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "PublicAgent's architecture employs five design principles derived from testing across 50 queries and various models. The system separates tasks into universal and conditional agents, achieving stable win rates of 86-92% for analysis and 84-94% for discovery. This indicates that focusing on workflow management rather than just reasoning can enhance overall performance."
