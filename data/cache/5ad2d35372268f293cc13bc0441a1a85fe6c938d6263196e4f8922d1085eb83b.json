  "speedrun": "In 2025, several technologies failed to meet expectations, earning spots on the list of the year's worst tech flops. These include products that were overly hyped but ultimately did not deliver value. For instance, some AI applications promised seamless integration but fell short in practicality and user experience. This matters now because it highlights the gap between innovation and real-world utility in technology.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Consumers may feel disillusioned by tech that fails to improve their lives, leading to skepticism about new products.",
    "The tech industry could see a shift towards more practical and user-focused innovations as companies learn from these failures."

    "eli12": "In 2025, some tech products really missed the mark, including AI tools that didn’t work as promised. Think of it like buying a fancy gadget that looks great but doesn’t help you at all. This is important for everyday people because it shows that not all new technology is worth the hype, and we should be cautious before jumping on the latest trends.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the failures of 2025 underscore the importance of aligning product offerings with real user needs. If a product is overly complicated or doesn’t solve a clear problem, it risks becoming another flop. This could lead to a greater emphasis on user feedback and iterative development to ensure products are genuinely useful.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the flops of 2025 often stemmed from overpromising capabilities without solid backing. For example, some AI systems claimed to enhance productivity but struggled with integration and user interaction. This serves as a reminder for engineers to prioritize practicality and user experience in their designs, ensuring that innovations are not just technically impressive but also user-friendly."
