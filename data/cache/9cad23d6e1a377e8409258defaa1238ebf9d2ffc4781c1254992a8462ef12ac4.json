  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.11902v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Enemy strategies in turn-based games should be surprising and unpredictable. This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies.

  "speedrun": "A new game mode called Mirror Mode has been introduced in the strategy game Fire Emblem Heroes, where the AI mimics players' strategies. This mode uses a blend of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning techniques, achieving good imitation of defensive behaviors but struggling with offensive ones. Early player tests showed that participants recognized their own retreating tactics, leading to higher satisfaction. This matters as it could enhance player engagement by challenging them to adapt their strategies continuously.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Players benefit from a more challenging experience, as the AI adapts to their tactics, pushing them to improve. This could lead to increased enjoyment and replayability.",
    "On a broader scale, this reflects a shift in game design towards more personalized AI, which could influence future developments in interactive entertainment."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Mirror Mode in Fire Emblem Heroes lets the game's AI copy how players play, making the game tougher and more fun. Think of it like a sparring partner who learns your moves and keeps you on your toes. This matters because it could make games more engaging, encouraging players to keep improving their skills.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, Mirror Mode highlights a user need for adaptive challenges in gaming. By using advanced AI techniques, games can enhance player satisfaction and retention. This could mean investing in AI development to create more personalized gaming experiences.",
    "engineer": "The technical approach in Mirror Mode combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization to model player strategies. Initial tests showed effective imitation of defensive tactics but less success with offensive ones. Improving these models could further enhance AI performance and player satisfaction."
