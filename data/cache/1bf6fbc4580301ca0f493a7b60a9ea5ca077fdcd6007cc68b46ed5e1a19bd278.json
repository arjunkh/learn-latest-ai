    "eli12": "Gradient boosted trees are like assembling a team of experts, where each expert learns from the mistakes of the previous one. This method helps create a stronger, more accurate model. For everyday people, better models mean improved services, like personalized recommendations or faster fraud detection.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding gradient boosted trees can enhance user experience through improved predictions and recommendations. Efficient tuning of these models could reduce costs and increase the effectiveness of data-driven features in products, ultimately leading to better user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, gradient boosted trees build models in a sequential manner, focusing on correcting errors from previous iterations. Libraries like XGBoost and LightGBM offer optimized implementations, which can significantly speed up training times. Tuning parameters such as learning rate and tree depth is critical for achieving high performance."
