  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.08671v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans. As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like India.",

  "speedrun": "A new study highlights the challenges of last-mile delivery in India's booming e-commerce market, where delivery costs make up nearly half of operational expenses. Traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers struggle with real-world complexities, but the study introduces a framework using large language models (LLMs) to enhance route evaluation. Remarkably, open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary models reached 86%. This advancement could significantly improve delivery efficiency and sustainability in developing regions.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to navigate a city with incomplete maps and confusing addresses. Thatâ€™s the challenge faced in last-mile delivery in India. This study shows how using large language models can help identify better routes, making deliveries faster and more reliable. This matters for everyday people because it could mean quicker deliveries and lower costs for online shopping.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study underscores the importance of integrating AI into logistics solutions. By enhancing route evaluation with LLMs, companies could meet user needs for faster deliveries while potentially lowering operational costs. This could lead to a competitive edge in a rapidly growing market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study leverages large language models to critique vehicle routing problem outputs, addressing real-world challenges like unstructured addresses. The LLMs achieved a 79% accuracy rate in identifying routing issues, while proprietary models reached 86%. This approach suggests a promising avenue for improving the effectiveness of traditional VRP solvers in complex environments."
