  "raw_body": "Google Cloud has introduced a big update in a bid to keep AI developers on its Vertex AI platform for concepting, designing, building, testing, deploying and modifying AI agents in enterprise use cases.\nThe new features, announced today, include additional governance tools for enterprises and expanding the capabilities for creating agents with just a few lines of code, moving faster with state-of-the-art context management layers and one-click deployment, as well as managed services for scaling production and evaluation, and support for identifying agents.\nAgent Builder, released last year during its annual Cloud Next event, provides a no-code platform for enterprises to create agents and connect these to orchestration frameworks like LangChain.\nGoogle’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), which lets developers build agents “in under 100 lines of code,” can also be accessed through Agent Builder. \n“These new capabilities underscore our commitment to Agent Builder, and simplify the agent development process to meet developers where they are, no matter which tech stack they choose,” said Mike Clark, director of Product Management, Vertex AI Agent Builder. \nBuild agents faster\nPart of Google’s pitch for Agent Builder’s new features is that enterprises can bake in-orchestration even as they construct their agents. \n“Building an agent from a concept to a working product involves complex orchestration,” said Clark. \nThe new capabilities, which are shipped with the ADK, include:\n\nSOTA context management layers including Static, Turn, User and Cache layers so enterprises have more control over the agents’ context\n\nPrebuilt plugins with customizable logic. One of the new plugins allows agents to recognize failed tool calls and “self-heal” by retrying the task with a different approach\n\nAdditional language support in ADK, including Go, alongside Python and Java, that launched with ADK\n\nOne-click deployment through the ADK command line interface to move agents from a local environment to live testing with a single command\n\nGovernance layer\nEnterprises require high accuracy; security; observability and auditability (what a program did and why); and steerability (control) in their production-grade AI agents.\nWhile Google had observability features in the local development environment at launch, developers can now access these tools through the Agent Engine managed runtime dashboard. \nThe company said this brings cloud-based production monitoring to track token consumption, error rates and latency. Within this observability dashboard, enterprises can visualize the actions agents take and reproduce any issues. \nAgent Engine will also have a new Evaluation Layer to help “simulate agent performance across a vast array of user interactions and situations.”\nThis governance layer will also include:\n\nAgent Identities that Google said give “agents their own unique, native identities within Google Cloud \n\nModel Armor, which would block prompt injections, screen tool calls and agent responses\n\nSecurity Command Center, so admins can build an inventory of their agents to detect threats like unauthorized access\n\n“These native identities provide a deep, built-in layer of control and a clear audit trail for all agent actions. These certificate-backed identities further strengthen your security as they cannot be impersonated and are tied directly to the agent's lifecycle, eliminating the risk of dormant accounts,” Clark said. \nThe battle of agent builders \nIt’s no surprise that model providers create platforms to build agents and bring them to production. The competition lies in how fast new tools and features are added.\nGoogle’s Agent Builder competes with OpenAI’s open-source Agent Development Kit, which enables developers to create AI agents using non-OpenAI models. \nAdditionally, there is the recently announced AgentKit, which features an Agent Builder that enables companies to integrate agents into their applications easily. \nMicrosoft has its Azure AI Foundry, launched last year around this time for AI agent creation, and AWS also offers agent builders on its Bedrock platform, but Google is hoping is suite of new features will help give it a competitive edge. \nHowever, it isn’t just companies with their own models that court developers to build their AI agents within their platforms. Any enterprise service provider with an agent library also wants clients to make agents on their systems. \nCapturing developer interest and keeping them within the ecosystem is the big battle between tech companies now, with features to make building and governing agents easier.",

  "speedrun": "Google Cloud has rolled out significant updates to its Vertex AI Agent Builder, enhancing tools for AI developers. Key features include a new observability dashboard for monitoring agent performance and faster build-and-deploy capabilities, allowing agents to be created with minimal code. This update aims to streamline the development process and improve governance, which is crucial for enterprises. As competition intensifies among tech giants, these enhancements could help Google retain developers on its platform.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Enterprises benefit from improved governance and faster deployment, which could enhance their efficiency in creating AI agents.",
    "The update signals a broader trend of tech companies racing to attract developers with better tools and features for AI agent development."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Google Cloud's latest update makes it easier for businesses to create AI agents quickly and effectively. Think of it like a new toolkit for building a model airplane, where you can now assemble parts faster and see how it flies in real-time. This matters because it helps businesses innovate and adapt in a fast-paced tech landscape.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this update simplifies the agent creation process, addressing the user need for efficiency and governance. The ability to deploy agents with just one command could reduce costs and speed up time-to-market. This means teams can focus more on refining their product rather than getting bogged down in technical details.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Google’s Agent Builder now includes advanced context management layers and a robust observability dashboard. The addition of prebuilt plugins allows for features like error recovery, enhancing agent resilience. These improvements could make the platform more appealing for developers looking for efficient, production-ready solutions."
