Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.",

  "speedrun": "A recent workshop highlighted the growing connection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), coining the term 'NeuroAI.' This approach aims to enhance AI algorithms by integrating insights from neuroscience, focusing on areas like language, robotics, and learning. Researchers believe this could reshape our understanding of both AI and biological neural computations. The implications of this synergy are significant as it may lead to more efficient AI systems and deeper insights into human cognition.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "NeuroAI could directly benefit researchers and developers by providing enhanced algorithms that mimic human learning processes more closely.",
    "This represents a broader shift in the tech landscape, suggesting that interdisciplinary approaches could lead to more advanced and efficient AI solutions."

    "eli12": "Imagine if AI could learn and communicate like a human, thanks to insights from neuroscience. This new field, NeuroAI, aims to bridge the gap between how our brains work and how machines can learn. It matters because it could lead to smarter AI that understands us better and helps us in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, NeuroAI presents an opportunity to create AI products that learn more efficiently and interact naturally with users. By leveraging neuroscience principles, they could reduce development costs and improve user satisfaction. This could make AI tools more intuitive and effective for a wide range of applications.",
    "engineer": "NeuroAI focuses on integrating neuroscience insights into AI development, particularly in areas like language processing and robotic learning. Researchers emphasize the potential for improved algorithms that reflect biological neural computations. While the approach shows promise, engineers should remain aware of the complexities in translating these biological principles into scalable AI models."
