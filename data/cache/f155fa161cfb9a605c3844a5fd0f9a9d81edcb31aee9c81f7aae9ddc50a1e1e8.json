    "eli12": "The London Great Agent Hack 2025 focused on creating AI agents that are not only smart but also can explain their decisions clearly. Think of it like teaching a robot to not just follow orders but also to share its thought process, making it easier for people to trust and understand its actions. This is important for everyone, as it means AI can be safer and more reliable in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the hack highlighted the need for AI solutions that are both robust and transparent. Users increasingly demand systems that can explain their reasoning, which could lead to higher trust and satisfaction. This focus on resilience may also reduce long-term costs associated with failures or misunderstandings in AI applications.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the event emphasized advancements in multi-agent systems that prioritize robustness and glass-box reasoning. These agents can adapt to dynamic environments while providing transparent decision-making processes. The focus on red-team resilience suggests a proactive approach to identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring that AI systems can withstand and recover from adversarial challenges."
