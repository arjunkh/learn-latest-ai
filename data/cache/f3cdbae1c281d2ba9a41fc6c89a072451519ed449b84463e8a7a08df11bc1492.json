  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.12864v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework to enhance how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle exceptions. This new technique allows LLMs to make decisions that align better with human intent, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score compared to 80% for traditional methods. The RID framework is designed to work with minimal computational resources, making it more accessible. This advancement could lead to more trustworthy AI systems capable of nuanced reasoning.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Practitioners can now implement more human-aligned AI without the high costs of traditional fine-tuning methods.",
    "This shift could signal a move towards more intuitive AI systems, enhancing user trust and adoption in various applications."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The RID Framework helps AI understand and respond to complex situations better. Think of it as teaching a student not just to follow rules but to understand the reasons behind them. This matters because it could make AI tools more effective and relatable for everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the RID Framework provides a way to develop AI that meets user needs more effectively. This approach could reduce costs associated with traditional training methods while improving decision-making quality. A practical implication is that products could become more user-friendly and adaptable to diverse scenarios.",
    "engineer": "The RID Framework enhances LLMs by allowing them to classify rules and weigh conflicting outcomes without extensive computation. In tests, it achieved a 95% Human Alignment Score, outperforming baseline and Chain-of-Thought prompting methods. This suggests that the RID could be a valuable tool for engineers looking to improve AI reasoning capabilities."
