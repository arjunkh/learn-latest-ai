    "eli12": "OpenAI is working on features that help determine how old a user is and allow parents to set controls for what their kids can see in ChatGPT. Think of it like a digital babysitter that keeps kids safe online. This matters because it helps ensure that young users have a better and safer experience while using technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, these new features highlight a growing user need for safety in digital interactions, especially for younger audiences. By integrating age prediction and parental controls, they can enhance user trust and satisfaction. A practical implication is that products catering to families may see increased adoption as safety becomes a priority.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, implementing age prediction involves developing algorithms that can analyze user interactions to estimate age accurately. OpenAI might leverage existing models and data sets to train these systems, ensuring they are effective. However, challenges could arise in balancing accuracy with privacy concerns."
