  "speedrun": "AI spending in the Asia Pacific region is increasing, but many companies are not seeing the expected return on their investments. This is largely due to inadequate infrastructure for running AI inference efficiently. Studies indicate that many projects fail to meet their performance goals. As companies shift their AI infrastructure to edge computing, they aim to enhance speed and scalability, making this a crucial moment for businesses to adapt.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies in the Asia Pacific are facing challenges in realizing the full potential of their AI investments due to infrastructure issues.",
    "The shift to edge computing could signal a broader industry trend towards optimizing AI performance, impacting how businesses deploy technology."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Many businesses in Asia are spending more on AI, but they're not getting the results they hoped for. This is because their systems can't handle AI tasks quickly enough. Think of it like trying to drive a sports car on a bumpy road; the car can go fast, but the road slows it down. Improving infrastructure could help companies get better results from their AI efforts.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rising costs of AI inference highlight the need for efficient infrastructure. Users expect quick responses, and if systems can't deliver, it could lead to dissatisfaction. Focusing on edge computing may help cut costs and improve performance, making it a strategic option for enhancing user experience.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, many AI systems in the Asia Pacific aren't optimized for inference, leading to performance bottlenecks. The shift towards edge computing could enable faster processing speeds and better scalability. However, engineers will need to ensure that the underlying architecture supports these demands to avoid potential pitfalls in implementation."
