    "eli12": "Many businesses tried using AI quickly but didn't see the results they hoped for. Mistral AI is working with companies to create custom AI solutions that actually help solve real problems. Think of it like getting a tailored suit instead of a one-size-fits-all outfit. This matters because it could help businesses use AI in a way that truly benefits them.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this focus on tailored AI solutions highlights the importance of understanding user needs. By co-designing with industry leaders, companies can create more effective products that address specific challenges. This could lead to better user experiences and increased efficiency, making it a strategic move in a competitive market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Mistral AI's approach emphasizes the need for customized solutions rather than generic models. Collaborating with companies like Cisco allows them to integrate specific requirements into the AI design process. This could lead to improved performance metrics and more relevant outcomes, although it requires careful consideration of each partner's unique challenges."
