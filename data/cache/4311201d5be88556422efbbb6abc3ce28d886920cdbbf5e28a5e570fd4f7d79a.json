  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.12985v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic, plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.",

  "speedrun": "The Sentinel framework has been introduced to evaluate the physical safety of Large Language Model (LLM)-based embodied agents. It uses formal temporal logic to set safety requirements, moving beyond previous methods that relied on heuristic rules. Sentinel operates at three levels: semantic, plan, and trajectory, ensuring a thorough safety check. This is significant as it could lead to safer AI applications in real-world environments, addressing potential risks more effectively than before.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could enhance the safety of AI systems, particularly for developers working with embodied agents in physical settings.",
    "By establishing a formal evaluation process, Sentinel represents a shift towards more rigorous safety standards in AI development, influencing industry best practices."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Sentinel is like a safety checklist for robots that use language to understand tasks. It breaks down safety checks into three parts, making sure AI systems know and follow safety rules before acting. This matters because as AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ensuring their safety is crucial for everyday interactions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Sentinel highlights the need for robust safety measures in AI products, especially those involving physical interactions. It could reduce the risk of accidents and improve user trust, potentially lowering liability costs. Implementing such frameworks may lead to safer and more reliable product launches.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Sentinel employs formal temporal logic to create a multi-level verification process for LLM-based agents. It assesses safety at semantic, plan, and trajectory levels, ensuring alignment with safety requirements. This approach can uncover safety violations that previous heuristic methods might miss, enhancing the reliability of embodied AI systems."
