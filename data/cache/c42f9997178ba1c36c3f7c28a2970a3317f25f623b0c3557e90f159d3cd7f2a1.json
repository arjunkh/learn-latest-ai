  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.07964v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores the use of Executable Ontologies (EO) in game development, shifting from traditional algorithmic programming to semantic world modeling. This approach allows agent behavior to emerge from domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. For example, in the survival game 'Winter Feast,' EO enables priority-based task interruptions using dataflow conditions. This matters now as it could enhance realism and responsiveness in game AI, setting a new standard for development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Game developers could create more dynamic and responsive AI characters, enhancing player experience through natural behavior.",
    "This shift toward semantic modeling could influence broader AI applications, potentially leading to more intuitive systems in various industries."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Executable Ontologies (EO) change how game AI works by allowing characters to act based on rules rather than strict programming. Think of it like a chef who knows the ingredients and can create dishes on the fly, rather than following a recipe step-by-step. This is important because it could make games feel more alive and engaging for players.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the shift to EO means developing more adaptive and intelligent game features that respond to player actions in real-time. This could reduce development costs by minimizing the need for complex coding. A practical implication is that teams might focus more on creating rich, rule-based environments rather than hardcoding every behavior.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Executable Ontologies leverage the boldsea framework to facilitate semantic world modeling, contrasting with traditional methods like Behavior Trees and GOAP. EO focuses on when actions can occur rather than what agents should do, addressing a significant gap in game AI architecture. This approach could lead to more efficient AI systems, particularly in complex scenarios like the 'Winter Feast' game."
