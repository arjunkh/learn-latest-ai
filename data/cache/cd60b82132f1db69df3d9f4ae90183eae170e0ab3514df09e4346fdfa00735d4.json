    "eli12": "Datadog is now using OpenAI's Codex to help developers review their code. Think of Codex as a helpful assistant that checks your work as you go along. This could make coding smoother and help catch mistakes early, which is important for everyone who relies on software to work properly.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, integrating Codex into code reviews could mean faster product releases and lower costs associated with bug fixes. This aligns with user needs for high-quality software delivered quickly. It also highlights the growing importance of AI in improving efficiency in tech teams.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Datadog's use of Codex for code reviews may enhance error detection and streamline the development process. Codex, based on the GPT-3 model, provides context-aware suggestions, which could reduce the time engineers spend on revisions. However, the effectiveness of Codex may vary depending on the complexity of the code being reviewed."
