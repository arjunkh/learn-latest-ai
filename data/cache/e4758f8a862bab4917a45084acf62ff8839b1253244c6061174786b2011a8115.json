  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.09142v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present SDialog, an MIT-licensed open-source Python toolkit that unifies dialog generation, evaluation and mechanistic interpretability into a single end-to-end framework for building and analyzing LLM-based conversational agents. Built around a standardized \\texttt{Dialog} representation, SDialog provides: (1) persona-driven multi-agent simulation with composable orchestration for controlled, synthetic dialog generation, (2) comprehensive evaluation combining linguistic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge and functional correctness validators, (3) mechanistic interpretability tools for activation inspection and steering via feature ablation and induction, and (4) audio generation with full acoustic simulation including 3D room modeling and microphone effects. The toolkit integrates with all major LLM backends, enabling mixed-backend experiments under a unified API. By coupling generation, evaluation, and interpretability in a dialog-centric architecture, SDialog enables researchers to build, benchmark and understand conversational systems more systematically.",

  "speedrun": "SDialog is a new open-source Python toolkit designed for creating and analyzing conversational agents. It combines dialog generation, evaluation, and interpretability in one framework, allowing users to simulate multi-agent conversations and evaluate them using various metrics. Notably, it integrates with major LLM backends, making it versatile for different experiments. This toolkit could significantly streamline research and development in the field of conversational AI, making it easier to build effective systems.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and developers can quickly create and test dialog systems, enhancing productivity and innovation in conversational AI.",
    "The integration of generation, evaluation, and interpretability signals a shift towards more systematic approaches in AI development, potentially improving overall system performance."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "SDialog is like a Swiss Army knife for building chatbots. It helps users create conversations, check how well they work, and understand how they think. This matters to everyday people because it could lead to smarter and more responsive AI in apps and services we use daily.",
    "pm": "For product managers, SDialog offers a streamlined way to develop and refine conversational agents. It addresses user needs by providing tools for simulation and evaluation, potentially reducing development time and costs. This means teams could focus more on improving user experience rather than troubleshooting.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, SDialog utilizes a standardized dialog representation to facilitate multi-agent simulations and comprehensive evaluations. It supports various LLM backends, allowing for mixed-backend experiments. This flexibility could enhance the robustness of conversational models by providing diverse testing environments."
