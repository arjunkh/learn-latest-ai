    "eli12": "Deploying a PICO Extractor involves a clear, step-by-step method to teach a computer how to recognize important information in text. Think of it like training a dog to fetch specific items; the clearer the commands, the better the results. This matters because it helps researchers quickly find what they need in vast amounts of data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this deployment process highlights the need for user-friendly AI tools that can efficiently handle specialized tasks. By focusing on clear data labeling and testing, teams could save time and resources. A practical implication is that companies can leverage these models to enhance their data analysis capabilities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, deploying a PICO Extractor requires a robust understanding of NER models, particularly in how they handle domain-specific language. Key steps include precise data labeling and iterative testing, which can significantly improve model performance. It's important to note that while this approach enhances accuracy, it may require substantial initial setup and ongoing adjustments."
