  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.18988v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called ACTMED aims to improve clinical diagnosis by integrating machine learning with real-world reasoning. By using Bayesian Experimental Design and large language models, ACTMED selects tests that most effectively reduce uncertainty for patients. This approach allows clinicians to stay engaged in the decision-making process. Its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy while optimizing resource use makes it particularly relevant in high-pressure medical environments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "ACTMED could significantly aid clinicians in making faster, more accurate diagnoses, especially in urgent care settings.",
    "This development reflects a broader shift towards adaptive, AI-supported healthcare solutions that prioritize clinician involvement and resource efficiency."

    "eli12": "Imagine a GPS that not only gives directions but also adapts based on traffic and road conditions. ACTMED does something similar for doctors, helping them choose the best tests based on real-time patient information. This could lead to quicker diagnoses and better patient outcomes, making healthcare more efficient and responsive to needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ACTMED highlights the importance of integrating AI in clinical workflows to enhance decision-making. By focusing on user needs for timely and accurate diagnoses, this framework could reduce costs and improve efficiency. It suggests a path for developing tools that support clinicians while allowing for flexibility in diagnosis.",
    "engineer": "ACTMED employs Bayesian Experimental Design alongside large language models to optimize test selection in clinical settings. By generating plausible patient state distributions, it enhances diagnostic accuracy without needing extensive structured data. This model's ability to adapt in real-time could represent a significant advancement in AI-driven diagnostics, although it requires careful evaluation in diverse clinical scenarios."
