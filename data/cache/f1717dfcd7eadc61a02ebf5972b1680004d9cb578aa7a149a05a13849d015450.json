  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00818v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called Agentic AI aims to transform credit risk decision-making by using autonomous AI agents that operate independently of human input. This system integrates multi-agent collaboration, real-time data processing, and explainable AI, leading to faster and more transparent decisions compared to traditional models. The research shows improved decision speed and responsiveness, though it also highlights challenges like model drift and regulatory uncertainties. This innovation could reshape how financial institutions assess credit risk in a rapidly digitalizing world.",

    "eli12": "Agentic AI is like having a smart assistant that makes decisions about loans without needing constant human input. It analyzes data in real time, making it faster and clearer than older methods. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to quicker loan approvals and more understanding of how credit decisions are made.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Agentic AI addresses the user need for efficient and transparent credit assessments. By automating decision-making, it could reduce costs and improve user experience. A practical implication is that financial products could be tailored more quickly to meet customer needs, enhancing competitiveness.",
    "engineer": "The Agentic AI framework employs multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning to autonomously assess credit risk. Key components include risk-scoring engines and interpretability layers, which enhance decision-making transparency. However, challenges like model drift and high-dimensional data interpretation need careful attention to ensure reliability and compliance."
