    "eli12": "Imagine AI as a referee in a sports game, helping teams understand who made a mistake when things go wrong. This technology can analyze data from different departments to find out why deliveries are late. By using AI, companies could work better together, making sure products reach customers on time. This matters because it affects how smoothly businesses run and how satisfied customers are.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights the importance of integrating AI into supply chain processes. It addresses the user need for accountability and efficiency in logistics. By reducing disputes, companies could save time and resources, leading to better service and potentially lower costs. This could also foster a more collaborative workplace culture.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, implementing AI in supply chain management involves using data analytics and machine learning models to identify patterns and root causes of delays. By connecting data from warehouses and transportation, AI can provide insights that traditional methods might miss. However, the effectiveness of these solutions depends on the quality and integration of data from both departments."
