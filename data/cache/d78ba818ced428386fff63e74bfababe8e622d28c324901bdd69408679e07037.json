  "raw_body": "One problem enterprises face is getting employees to actually use the AI agents their dev teams have built. \nGoogle, which has already shipped many AI tools through its Workspace apps, has made Google Workspace Studio generally available to give more employees access to design, manage and share AI agents, further democratizing agentic workflows. This puts Google directly in competition with Microsoft’s Copilot and undercuts some integrations that brought OpenAI’s ChatGPT into enterprise applications. \nWorkspace Studio is powered by Gemini 3, and while it primarily targets business teams rather than developers, it offers builders a way to offload lower-priority agent tasks.  \n\n“We’ve all lost countless hours to the daily grind: Sifting through emails, juggling calendar logistics and chasing follow-up tasks,” Farhaz Karmali, product director for the Google Workspace Ecosystem, wrote in a blog post. “Legacy automation tools tried to help, but they were simply too rigid and technical for the everyday user. That’s why we’re bringing custom agents directly into Workspace with Studio — so you can delegate these repetitive tasks to agents that can reason, understand context and handle the work that used to slow you down.”\nThe platform can bring agents to Workspace apps such as Google Docs and Sheets, as well as to third-party tools like Salesforce or Jira.\nMore AI in applications \nInterest in AI agents continues to grow, and while many enterprises have begun deploying them in their workflows, they're finding it isn’t as easy to get users on board as expected. The problem is that using agents can sometimes break employees out of their flow, so organizations have to figure out how to integrate agents where users are already fully engaged. The most common way of interacting with agents so far remains a chat screen. \nAWS released Quick Sight in hopes of attracting more front- and middle-office workers to use AI agents, although access to agents is still through a chatbot. OpenAI has desktop integrations that bring ChatGPT to specific apps. And, of course, Microsoft Copilot helped was ahead of this trend. \nGoogle has an advantage that only Microsoft rivals: It already offers applications that most people use. Enterprise employees use Google Workspace applications, host data and documents on Drive and send emails through Gmail. \nThis means Google can easily get the context enterprises need to power their agents and reach millions of users. \nIf people build agents through Workspace Studio, the platform can prove that agents targeting workplace applications, not just Google Docs, but also Microsoft Word, could be a winning strategy to increase agent adoption from employees.  \nTemplatizing agent creation\n\nEnterprise employees can choose from a template or write out what they need in a prompt window. \nA look around the Workspace Studio platform showed templates such as “auto-create tasks when files are added to a folder” or “create Jira issues for emails with action issues.”\nKarmali said Workspace Studio is being “deeply integrated with Workspace apps like Gmail, Drive and Chat,” and agents built on the platform can “understand the full context of your work.” \n“This allows them to provide help that matches your company’s policies and processes while generating personalized content in your tone and style,\" he said. \"You can even view your agent activity directly from the side panels of your favorite Workspace apps.\" \nTeams can extend agents to third-party enterprise platforms, but they can also configure custom steps to integrate with other tools.",
