    "eli12": "Google's new AI, CodeMender, helps fix security problems in software automatically. Think of it like a digital repairman who quickly finds and fixes leaks in a building. This matters because it can help keep our software safer and reduce the time developers spend on fixing issues.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, CodeMender addresses a crucial user need by streamlining security updates. It could lower costs and improve efficiency by reducing the manual effort required for vulnerability management. This means teams can focus on building features rather than constantly patching security holes.",
    "engineer": "CodeMender utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and rectify vulnerabilities in code, achieving 72 fixes for open-source projects in six months. This performance highlights its potential efficiency compared to traditional methods, which often require extensive human intervention. However, engineers should remain cautious about the AI's limitations and the need for ongoing oversight."
