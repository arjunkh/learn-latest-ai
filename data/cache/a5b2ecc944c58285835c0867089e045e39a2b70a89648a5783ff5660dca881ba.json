  "speedrun": "A new trend in AI, called 'agentic AI,' is emerging, which allows systems to plan and adapt towards specific goals. This marks a significant shift from traditional automation, which mainly focuses on task completion. Key players are investing heavily in these systems, aiming to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. As businesses increasingly adopt agentic AI, understanding its implications becomes crucial for staying competitive.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies leveraging agentic AI could see improved customer interactions, as these systems adapt to user needs in real-time.",
    "The rise of agentic AI indicates a broader shift towards more intelligent automation, potentially reshaping industries and job roles."

    "eli12": "Agentic AI is like teaching a dog not just to fetch, but to decide which toy to bring based on your mood. This smarter approach could make our interactions with technology feel more personal and responsive. Understanding agentic AI helps everyday people see how their experiences with customer service and online shopping might improve.",
    "pm": "For product managers, agentic AI highlights the need to prioritize user adaptability in design. This could lead to more efficient solutions that respond to customer preferences dynamically. Implementing these systems might also reduce operational costs by automating complex decision-making processes.",
    "engineer": "Agentic AI systems utilize advanced models that allow them to plan and adapt based on user interactions. These systems often rely on reinforcement learning techniques, which optimize their actions over time. However, engineers should be mindful of the complexities involved in ensuring these systems behave reliably in diverse scenarios."
