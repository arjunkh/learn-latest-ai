  "speedrun": "Decentralised AI is gaining attention for its potential to empower users by shifting control away from a few large entities. However, significant challenges remain that could hinder its development and adoption. Key issues include ensuring security and managing the complexity of decentralized systems. As interest in this technology grows, addressing these challenges becomes increasingly important for its future impact.",

    "eli12": "Decentralised AI is like a community garden where everyone can plant and harvest their own crops, rather than relying on a single grocery store. This could give people more control over the technology they use. However, just like a garden needs care, decentralised AI faces challenges like security and complexity. If these issues are resolved, it could lead to more user-friendly and ethical technology for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, decentralised AI presents both opportunities and challenges. Users are increasingly seeking more control over their technology, which could drive demand for decentralised solutions. However, the complexity and security issues could increase development costs and timeframes. Understanding these dynamics will be crucial for creating effective products that meet user needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, decentralised AI relies on distributed networks to function, which can introduce challenges in security and data management. Current models often struggle to balance efficiency with user control, making it difficult to implement robust solutions. Engineers must navigate these complexities to develop systems that not only work well but also maintain user trust and security."
