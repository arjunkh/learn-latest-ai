  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.11182v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics and discuss ways to address these.",

  "speedrun": "This article expands the study of admissibility in assumption-based argumentation (ABA) by introducing strong and weak admissibility concepts. It highlights their implications for non-flat ABA frameworks, enhancing our understanding of argumentation semantics and their properties, which could influence future research and applications in AI and decision-making systems.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "The introduction of strong admissibility in ABA provides a new framework for evaluating arguments, potentially improving AI systems' reasoning capabilities and decision-making processes.",
    "By addressing limitations in existing admissibility semantics, this research opens avenues for more robust argumentation models, which can enhance conflict resolution and negotiation strategies in various fields."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This article talks about new ways to think about arguments in AI. It looks at strong and weak admissibility, which help us understand how to judge arguments better. This is cool because it can help AI make smarter decisions and solve problems more effectively.",
    "pm": "Researchers and AI developers will use these new admissibility concepts to improve argumentation systems. They solve issues related to evaluating complex arguments and provide a competitive edge in AI reasoning. However, businesses must be cautious about integrating these theories without thorough testing.",
    "engineer": "The article employs abstract bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks to explore strong and weak admissibility in non-flat ABA. This technical approach allows for a nuanced understanding of argument relationships, though it may face challenges in scalability and practical application in real-world scenarios."
