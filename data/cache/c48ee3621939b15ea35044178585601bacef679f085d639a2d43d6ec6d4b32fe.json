  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.07866v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework aimed at improving maternal health risk assessments in Bangladesh. By combining fuzzy logic with SHAP explanations, the model achieved 88.67% accuracy on 1,014 health records. Clinicians showed a strong preference for this approach, with 71.4% favoring the hybrid explanations. This development is crucial as it addresses the trust gap in clinical settings, potentially enhancing the adoption of AI in maternal healthcare.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could significantly improve maternal health outcomes in Bangladesh by providing clearer explanations, thus fostering trust among healthcare professionals.",
    "The study highlights a broader shift towards integrating AI into healthcare, emphasizing the need for transparency and trust in technology to drive adoption."

    "eli12": "This research shows how AI can help predict risks for mothers during pregnancy, which is especially important in places with limited resources. Think of it like a weather forecast that gives you not just the chance of rain, but also explains why it might rain. This matters because clearer explanations can lead to better care for mothers and babies.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study underscores the importance of building trust in AI applications, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare. Understanding user needs for clear explanations could improve adoption rates. The hybrid model's success suggests that integrating explainability features may enhance user confidence and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The study presents a fuzzy-XGBoost model, achieving an impressive 88.67% accuracy with a ROC-AUC of 0.9703 on maternal health records. The integration of fuzzy logic with SHAP explanations allows for a more interpretable model, which is crucial in clinical settings. However, clinicians noted gaps in critical data, emphasizing the need for comprehensive data collection to enhance model performance."
