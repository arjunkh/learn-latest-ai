  "speedrun": "Google Trends is a popular tool for analyzing human behavior, but it has a fundamental flaw that many users overlook. When working with time series data, this flaw can lead to significant misinterpretations. For instance, trends may not accurately reflect actual interest levels over time. Understanding this issue is crucial for researchers and analysts to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from their data.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and analysts relying on Google Trends could misinterpret data, leading to flawed insights and decisions.",
    "This highlights a broader challenge in data analysis, where popular tools may not always provide accurate representations of reality."

    "eli12": "Google Trends helps people see what topics are popular, but it can be misleading. Imagine trying to read a book with missing pages; you might get the wrong idea about the story. This matters because if researchers misinterpret trends, they could make poor decisions that affect many people.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding Google Trends data is essential for gauging user interest. Misleading trends could lead to misguided product development or marketing strategies. By recognizing these pitfalls, teams can make more informed decisions that align with actual user needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Google Trends data can skew time series analyses due to its sampling methods and normalization processes. For instance, spikes might not correlate with real-world events, leading to inaccurate model predictions. Engineers should be cautious when integrating this data into machine learning models, considering its limitations."
