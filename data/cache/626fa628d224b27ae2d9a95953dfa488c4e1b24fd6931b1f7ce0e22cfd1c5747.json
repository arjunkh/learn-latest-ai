    "eli12": "AWS's Nova Forge is like a customizable recipe for making AI models. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, businesses can add their own unique ingredients—like their data—to create something that fits their needs perfectly. This matters to everyday people because it means companies can make smarter decisions based on their specific situations.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Nova Forge represents an opportunity to meet user needs more effectively by creating bespoke AI solutions. This could lead to improved efficiency and cost savings, as businesses can utilize their own data rather than relying solely on generic models. A practical implication is the potential for faster innovation cycles, as companies can iterate on their models more swiftly.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Nova Forge allows for the integration of proprietary data into existing AI frameworks, enhancing model performance while maintaining foundational capabilities. It suggests a move towards modular AI systems, where businesses can customize aspects without extensive redevelopment. This could improve the speed and efficiency of model training and deployment, although the effectiveness may vary based on the quality of the integrated data."
