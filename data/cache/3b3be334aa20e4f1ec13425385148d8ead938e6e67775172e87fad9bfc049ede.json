  "speedrun": "Google has made a groundbreaking move by releasing data on the energy consumption of its Gemini AI applications, revealing that the median prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours, akin to running a microwave for one second. This transparency marks a significant step in understanding the environmental impact of AI technologies and encourages more sustainable practices in the industry.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "By quantifying energy use, Google sets a precedent for accountability in AI, pushing other companies to disclose their energy consumption and fostering a culture of sustainability.",
    "This data can inform users and developers about the environmental footprint of AI applications, potentially influencing design choices and prompting innovations aimed at reducing energy consumption."

    "eli12": "Google has shared how much energy its AI uses for each question. A typical question uses a small amount of power, like running a microwave for just one second. This is exciting because it helps us understand how AI affects the environment and encourages companies to be more careful about energy use.",
    "pm": "Developers and businesses using Google's Gemini AI will benefit from this energy data, allowing them to optimize usage and reduce costs. It addresses concerns about the environmental impact of AI, providing a competitive edge for companies that prioritize sustainability. However, there's a risk that high energy consumption could deter potential users focused on eco-friendly practices.",
    "engineer": "Google's report utilizes a detailed analysis of energy consumption metrics for its Gemini AI applications, employing methods to measure watt-hour usage per prompt. While the median energy consumption is relatively low, it highlights the need for ongoing optimization to improve efficiency. Limitations include variability in energy use based on query complexity and potential scalability issues as usage increases."
