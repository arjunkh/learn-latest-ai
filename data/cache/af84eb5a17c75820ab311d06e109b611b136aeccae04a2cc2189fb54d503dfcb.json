    "eli12": "Micron Technology, founded in 1978, is shifting its focus to meet the growing demand for memory used in AI. This change may impact consumers as products could become harder to find or more expensive. Think of it like a restaurant changing its menu to focus on gourmet dishes; some favorites might disappear. This matters because it affects what technology we can access in the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Micron's shift indicates a need to adapt to new memory requirements driven by AI. As consumer electronics evolve, understanding these changes could help in aligning product development with market demands. This could also mean higher costs for sourcing components, impacting pricing strategies. Keeping an eye on these trends is essential for staying competitive.",
    "engineer": "Micron's pivot towards AI memory reflects a significant change in semiconductor economics, as demand for specialized memory increases. This shift may require engineers to focus on optimizing memory architectures for AI workloads, which often require higher bandwidth and capacity. The transition could also lead to new benchmarks in memory performance, emphasizing efficiency. Engineers should be aware of these trends to align their designs with future needs."
