    "eli12": "Managing large datasets can feel like trying to carry too many groceries at once; it slows you down. Polars and DuckDB help by making it easier to handle this data without getting bogged down. For everyday people, this means faster insights and decisions based on data, which can impact everything from shopping habits to business strategies.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, using Polars and DuckDB could improve user experience by speeding up data processing capabilities. This efficiency may reduce costs associated with data handling and storage. Practically, it means faster feature releases and more responsive applications, aligning with user demands for quick insights.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Polars utilizes Rust for performance, enabling it to process data in parallel and significantly reduce memory consumption. DuckDB, on the other hand, is optimized for analytical queries, making it efficient for complex data operations. These tools could reshape how engineers approach data processing, especially as datasets grow larger."
