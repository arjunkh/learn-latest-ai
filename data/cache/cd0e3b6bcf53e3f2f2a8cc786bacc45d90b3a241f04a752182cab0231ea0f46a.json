    "eli12": "The AI hype correction in 2025 means people are starting to realize that AI isn't a magic solution to all problems. Just like overhyped gadgets that don't live up to the promise, users are finding limitations with AI tools. This matters because it encourages more realistic expectations and could lead to better, more useful AI in the long run.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this correction signals the need to focus on user needs and practical applications rather than flashy features. It could also mean tighter budgets as investors become more cautious. A practical implication is the potential for developing more robust AI tools that genuinely solve user problems.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the hype correction may push engineers to refine AI models and improve their accuracy and efficiency. With users now aware of limitations, there's an opportunity to develop AI systems that are more reliable. This could involve focusing on benchmarks that reflect real-world performance rather than just theoretical capabilities."
