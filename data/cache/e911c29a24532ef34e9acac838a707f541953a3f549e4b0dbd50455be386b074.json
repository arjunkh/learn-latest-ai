    "eli12": "Think of big data like a giant library filled with books. Each book represents information that could help a business, but if no one knows how to find or read them, the knowledge remains untapped. For everyday people, this means companies might miss out on improving products or services that could benefit consumers.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the challenge of using AI data effectively highlights a crucial user need: turning information into insights. This could lead to higher costs if companies invest in data collection without a clear strategy. A practical implication is the need for tools that simplify data analysis, making it easier to derive actionable strategies.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the struggle with AI data reflects limitations in current models and frameworks for data analysis.
