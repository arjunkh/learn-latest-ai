  "speedrun": "The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic is a key tool banks use to assess credit risk when approving loans. It measures how well a model distinguishes between good and bad borrowers. A higher KS value indicates better model performance, with values above 0.4 often considered strong. Understanding this helps banks make informed lending decisions, impacting both their profitability and consumer access to credit.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For banks, using the KS statistic can directly affect loan approval rates, helping them minimize risk and maximize return.",
    "This reflects a broader trend in finance where data-driven decision-making is becoming essential for competitiveness and risk management."

    "eli12": "The KS statistic helps banks figure out how likely a borrower is to repay a loan. Think of it like a score that tells banks how good they are at spotting reliable borrowers. This matters for everyday people because it affects whether they can get loans and at what interest rates.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the KS statistic is crucial for developing tools that help banks evaluate loan applicants. It highlights user needs for accurate risk assessment while potentially lowering costs by reducing defaults. This could lead to more efficient loan approval processes and better customer experiences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the KS statistic compares the cumulative distributions of two groups—approved and rejected borrowers. A KS value above 0.4 indicates strong predictive power, making it a reliable benchmark for model performance in credit risk. However, it's essential to consider the context, as different datasets may yield varying results."
