    "eli12": "Think of a rules engine like a traffic light system that directs cars based on conditions. By simplifying how it makes decisions using sparse algebra, it can operate more smoothly and quickly. This matters because faster decision-making can improve everyday technology we rely on.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this new design could mean creating more responsive applications that meet user needs efficiently. By lowering the complexity of rule evaluation, costs could decrease, leading to better resource allocation. This insight might help in developing features that enhance user experience.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, this approach utilizes sparse algebra to streamline propositional logic, potentially leading to significant performance improvements. By focusing on efficient data structures, the design could handle larger sets of rules with less computational overhead. However, the article doesnâ€™t detail specific benchmarks, which could be important for assessing its effectiveness."
