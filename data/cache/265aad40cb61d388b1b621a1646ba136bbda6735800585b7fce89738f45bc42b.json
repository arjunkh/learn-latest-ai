We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book \"Life and Death Dictionary\" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored how modern Go solvers tackle Life-and-Death problems using Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS). The research analyzed seven problems from a respected Go book and found that solvers identified key areas and even discovered rare patterns. Interestingly, they provided different answers for two problems compared to established solutions. This study matters now as it highlights both advancements in AI and the discrepancies between machine and human problem-solving in Go.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Go players can use insights from the study to refine their strategies, enhancing their game play through a better understanding of critical zones.",
    "The findings indicate a shift in how AI approaches complex problem-solving, suggesting that machine learning techniques could evolve to better mimic human reasoning."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI solves tricky problems in Go, focusing on key areas called relevance-zones. Think of it like finding the most important parts of a puzzle to solve it faster. For everyday players, understanding these zones can improve their strategy and game performance.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, this study highlights a user need for advanced tools that can analyze complex patterns in games. The findings suggest potential improvements in AI efficiency, which could lead to more effective training tools for players. This could ultimately enhance user engagement and learning.",
    "engineer": "The study utilized Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) to analyze seven Life-and-Death problems, revealing that solvers identified critical relevance-zones and discovered rare patterns. However, the solvers misjudged rare patterns' values and prioritized immediate survival over territory maximization, differing from human players. Addressing these issues could improve future AI models in Go."
