  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.16330v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a new paradigm that extends LLMs' capabilities beyond text generation to dynamic interaction with external environments. By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and tool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web navigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in ensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent performance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains, especially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and systematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents. We begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to stakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by situating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review datasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations. Next, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups: methods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions. Moreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and generalizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated into agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and cost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations with architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting opportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled research on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse applications.",

  "speedrun": "A new survey highlights the growing importance of generalizability in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, which are now being used in areas like web navigation and robotics. The report emphasizes that while these agents can interact dynamically with their environments, ensuring they perform consistently across diverse tasks remains a challenge. It also identifies gaps in current methodologies for measuring and improving generalizability. This is crucial now as the demand for reliable AI applications continues to rise.",

    "eli12": "This survey talks about how AI agents, which use Large Language Models, need to be good at adapting to different tasks. Think of it like a Swiss Army knife that must work well in many situations, not just one. This matters for everyone because better AI can help us in everyday tasks, from managing our homes to navigating the web.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this survey highlights a critical user need: agents that can adapt to various tasks without losing effectiveness. Improving generalizability could lead to more efficient products, reducing costs related to retraining models. A practical implication is that focusing on this aspect might enhance user satisfaction and broaden market appeal.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the survey reviews the current limitations in measuring generalizability of LLM-based agents, emphasizing a need for standardized metrics. It categorizes methods aimed at enhancing generalizability into three groups: those targeting the LLM backbone, agent components, and their interactions. This nuanced understanding could guide engineers in developing more reliable and adaptable AI systems."
