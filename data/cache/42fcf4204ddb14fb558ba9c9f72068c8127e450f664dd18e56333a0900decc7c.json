    "eli12": "Using large language models for time-series analysis is like having a smart assistant that helps you understand trends over time. By crafting the right questions, you can get clearer answers about future patterns. This matters to everyday people, as better predictions can lead to improved services and products based on consumer behavior.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this development highlights the need for intuitive data analysis tools that can meet user demands for accuracy. By utilizing LLMs, teams could reduce costs associated with manual analysis and improve overall efficiency. A practical implication is the ability to quickly generate insights that inform product development and marketing strategies.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, prompt engineering plays a crucial role in guiding LLMs to analyze time-series data effectively. By using targeted prompts, models can achieve higher accuracy in predictions compared to generic queries. This approach could lead to advancements in how machine learning models are trained and applied in real-world scenarios."
