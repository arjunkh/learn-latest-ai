  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.21420v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.",

  "speedrun": "A new study explores feasible strategies in three-way conflict analysis, focusing on how to resolve conflicts rather than just understand them. It introduces weighted measures for consistency and non-consistency, helping to identify effective strategies among groups of agents. The research applied these models to NBA labor negotiations and development plans in Gansu Province, showing improved results compared to existing methods. This matters now as it offers a more systematic approach to conflict resolution, which is crucial in various sectors.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations involved in conflicts, like sports leagues or regional governments, could benefit from more effective resolution strategies, leading to quicker agreements.",
    "This research indicates a shift toward more data-driven approaches in conflict resolution, potentially influencing how negotiations are conducted across industries."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how to solve conflicts between groups rather than just analyzing them. Think of it like finding the best way to divide a pie among friends, ensuring everyone feels satisfied. This approach could help everyday people resolve disputes more effectively, whether in workplaces or community settings.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of structured conflict resolution strategies in team dynamics. By understanding how to evaluate and address conflicts, they could improve collaboration and efficiency, potentially leading to better product outcomes. Implementing these strategies could streamline decision-making processes.",
    "engineer": "The study develops algorithms that compute overall ratings for groups of agents, incorporating weighted measures for consistency and non-consistency. By applying these models to real-world case studies, the authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms traditional methods. This could lead to more robust conflict analysis tools in various applications, enhancing decision-making in complex scenarios."
