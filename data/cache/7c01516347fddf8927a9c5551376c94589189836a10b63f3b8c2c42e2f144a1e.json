    "eli12": "The article explains that while AI can analyze data fast, it often misses the finer details that humans notice. Think of AI as a fast reader who skips over important context. This matters because in industries like manufacturing, overlooking small signs can lead to big problems, making human analysts essential.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this article emphasizes the importance of integrating human insights with AI tools. Users need reliable predictions for maintenance, and solely relying on AI could lead to overlooked details. A practical takeaway is to ensure that teams combine AI capabilities with human expertise to optimize product performance.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article discusses how AI models can analyze large amounts of bearing vibration data but may struggle with contextual nuances. For example, while AI might identify trends, it could miss subtle anomalies that experienced analysts would recognize. This highlights the need for a hybrid approach that leverages both AI efficiency and human analytical skills."
