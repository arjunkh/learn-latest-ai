    "eli12": "Huawei has made a toolkit called CANN available for free, which helps people build AI programs. This is exciting because it gives everyone a chance to create cool AI stuff without needing expensive tools.",
    "pm": "Developers and companies in AI will use the CANN toolkit to create applications more affordably. It solves the problem of high costs associated with CUDA, offering a competitive edge for those who adopt it early. However, there are risks of fragmentation in the AI development community.",
    "engineer": "CANN is designed to optimize neural network computations, potentially offering performance improvements over CUDA. Its open-source nature allows for community-driven enhancements, but it may face limitations in compatibility with existing NVIDIA hardware and software ecosystems."
