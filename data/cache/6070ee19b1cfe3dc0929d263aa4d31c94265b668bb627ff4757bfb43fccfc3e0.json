  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.13782v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights the limitations of advanced vision language models (VLMs) like DeepSeek R1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro in spatial reasoning tasks. A new benchmark called SpatiaLite shows that these models struggle with tasks requiring visual spatial relations, particularly as complexity increases. For example, their token usage can spike dramatically with more complex transformations. Understanding these limitations is crucial as VLMs become more integrated into applications requiring spatial awareness.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research impacts developers and researchers focused on enhancing VLMs, as it identifies critical areas for improvement in spatial reasoning capabilities.",
    "At a broader level, this could shift how AI is applied in fields like robotics and navigation, where spatial reasoning is essential for effectiveness."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to solve a puzzle without seeing the pieces clearly. That’s how current VLMs handle spatial reasoning—they rely too much on text and struggle with visual tasks. This matters because improving their spatial understanding could lead to smarter AI that can better assist in everyday tasks, like navigation or even virtual reality.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research underscores the need to enhance VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities to meet user demands in applications like augmented reality. The inefficiencies noted could lead to higher operational costs if not addressed. A practical implication is that future products may require better training data focused on spatial tasks to improve performance.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study introduces the SpatiaLite benchmark, which evaluates spatial reasoning accuracy and efficiency in VLMs. It reveals that these models heavily rely on linguistic representations, leading to deficiencies in visual tasks, especially as complexity rises. The proposed Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) aims to build a more robust internal world model for spatial reasoning, highlighting a potential pathway for future improvements."
