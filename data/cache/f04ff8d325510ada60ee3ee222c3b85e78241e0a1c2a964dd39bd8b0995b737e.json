  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.07866v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a hybrid explainable AI framework for maternal health risk assessment in Bangladesh, addressing the trust gap in clinical settings. The fuzzy-XGBoost model achieved 88.67% accuracy using 1,014 maternal health records. Clinicians showed a strong preference for the hybrid explanations, with 71.4% favoring them across cases. This research matters now as it could enhance the adoption of AI in healthcare, particularly in resource-limited environments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could directly improve maternal health outcomes by fostering clinician trust in AI tools, crucial for effective decision-making.",
    "It signals a broader trend toward integrating explainable AI in healthcare, potentially transforming how medical professionals utilize technology in patient care."

    "eli12": "This study tackles a big issue: how to make AI understandable for doctors. Think of it like giving a car's dashboard clear indicators instead of just a speedometer. This clarity could help healthcare workers trust AI tools more, ultimately leading to better care for mothers.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights a key user need: trust in AI. By addressing explainability, products could see higher adoption rates among healthcare professionals. The focus on maternal health also suggests a niche market with significant impact potential.",
    "engineer": "The study utilizes a fuzzy-XGBoost model, achieving an impressive 88.67% accuracy and a ROC-AUC of 0.9703 on maternal health records. It combines ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, showing that integrating clinical parameters can enhance AI's interpretability, although some critical gaps remain in data collection."
