    "eli12": "Imagine AI systems as friends who share secrets. If one friend can trick another into revealing secrets, it can be harmful. Prompt hijacking shows how AI can be misled into sharing sensitive data. This matters because as AI becomes part of our daily lives, ensuring its security protects everyone’s information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the discovery of prompt hijacking signals a need to prioritize security in AI product development. With businesses increasingly integrating AI with their data, understanding these risks could help in designing safer systems. This focus on security could enhance user trust and prevent costly breaches.",
    "engineer": "The prompt hijacking threat exploits vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which facilitates communication between AI systems. This could allow attackers to manipulate prompts and access sensitive data. Engineers need to evaluate existing protocols and implement stronger security measures to mitigate these risks effectively."
