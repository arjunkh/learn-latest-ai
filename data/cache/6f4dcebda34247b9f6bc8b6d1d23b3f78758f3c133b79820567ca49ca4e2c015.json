  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.10704v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.",

  "speedrun": "A new system called Maestro has been introduced to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by allowing models to self-improve based on initial prompts. It features two main innovations: self-critique, where multimodal agents identify and correct image weaknesses, and self-evolution, which uses comparisons to refine prompts. Experiments show that Maestro significantly boosts image quality compared to initial prompts and existing methods. This development could change how users interact with T2I models, making them more efficient and user-friendly.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Artists and designers could benefit from faster, more intuitive image generation without constant manual adjustments.",
    "This innovation indicates a shift towards more autonomous AI systems, reducing reliance on human input and enhancing creative workflows."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Maestro is like having a helpful assistant that not only creates images from your ideas but also learns to improve them over time. It critiques its own work and makes adjustments based on your preferences. This could make it easier for anyone to create high-quality images, even if they donâ€™t have technical skills.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Maestro represents a potential shift in user experience for creative tools. By reducing the need for manual prompt adjustments, it could save users time and increase satisfaction. This means products could become more appealing and accessible to a broader audience.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Maestro employs a self-critique mechanism with multimodal LLM agents that assess image quality and suggest edits. It also uses a self-evolution approach to refine prompts through head-to-head comparisons of generated images. This method has shown significant improvements in image quality, particularly with more sophisticated MLLM components, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous T2I systems."
