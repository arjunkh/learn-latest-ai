  "raw_body": "Ridge and Lasso regression are often perceived as more complex versions of linear regression. In reality, the prediction model remains exactly the same. What changes is the training objective. By adding a penalty on the coefficients, regularization forces the model to choose more stable solutions, especially when features are correlated. Implementing Ridge and Lasso step by step in Excel makes this idea explicit: regularization does not add complexity, it adds preference.\nThe post The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Day 13: LASSO and Ridge Regression in Excel appeared first on Towards Data Science.",

  "speedrun": "Day 13 of the Machine Learning Advent Calendar focuses on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are often seen as complex variations of linear regression. However, the core prediction model remains unchanged; only the training objective shifts. By applying a penalty to the coefficients, these methods encourage more stable solutions, particularly when dealing with correlated features. Understanding this distinction is crucial as it simplifies the implementation of these techniques in Excel.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data scientists and analysts can enhance model performance with regularization techniques, leading to better predictions in real-world applications.",
    "The growing emphasis on model stability reflects a broader trend in data science towards more reliable and interpretable machine learning solutions."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Ridge and Lasso regression help make predictions more reliable by adding a penalty to the model's coefficients. Think of it like a coach encouraging players to focus on teamwork rather than individual skills. This ensures that the model performs better even when data features are closely related, which is important for everyday decision-making.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding Ridge and Lasso regression can improve user experience by ensuring more accurate predictions. These techniques help manage costs by reducing overfitting, making models more efficient. Implementing them could enhance the reliability of features that depend on data-driven decisions.",
    "engineer": "Ridge and Lasso regression modify the training objective of linear regression by incorporating penalties on the coefficients. Ridge uses L2 regularization, while Lasso employs L1 regularization, which can lead to sparse solutions. This approach is particularly useful when features are correlated, as it stabilizes the model and improves prediction accuracy."
