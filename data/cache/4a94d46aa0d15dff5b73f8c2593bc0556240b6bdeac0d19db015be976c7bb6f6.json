    "eli12": "DeepSeek, a company working on AI, is having trouble because the chips made by Huawei aren't good enough for their new model. This is important because it shows that not all technology is equally effective, and it might slow down new AI developments that could help everyone.",
    "pm": "DeepSeek's AI model is aimed at researchers and businesses needing advanced AI solutions. The chip performance issues hinder development speed, creating an opportunity for competitors with better hardware. Companies may face risks in project delays and increased costs, pushing them to seek more reliable chip suppliers.",
    "engineer": "DeepSeek's model relies on high-performance computing, which is critical for training AI effectively. The failure of Huawei's chips indicates limitations in processing power and efficiency, which could lead to slower training times. This situation highlights the need for robust hardware solutions in AI development, as any constraints can significantly impact overall performance."
