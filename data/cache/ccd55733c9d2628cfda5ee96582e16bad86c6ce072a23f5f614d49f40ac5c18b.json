  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.16681v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and real-time feedback are essential.",

  "speedrun": "A study highlights the importance of rule-based systems for detecting stuttering, which affects about 1% of the global population. These systems achieved 97-99% accuracy in detecting speech prolongations, crucial for clinical settings. This matters now as healthcare increasingly relies on interpretable AI to improve patient care and communication.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Speech therapists and clinicians can leverage these interpretable models to better assess and treat stuttering, enhancing patient outcomes.",
    "As healthcare integrates more AI, rule-based systems provide a reliable option that balances accuracy with the need for transparency in clinical decision-making."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to fix a car without knowing how it works. Rule-based stuttering detection gives therapists clear insights into speech patterns, helping them support people who stutter. This approach is important for everyday communication, making it easier for those affected to express themselves confidently.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the need for solutions that blend advanced technology with user-friendly interfaces. Understanding user needs for transparency and interpretability can set products apart. A practical next step is to explore how these rule-based systems can enhance existing speech therapy tools.",
    "engineer": "This study examines rule-based stuttering detection, emphasizing its interpretability compared to deep learning methods. With a focus on accuracy in prolongation detection, these systems can be integrated into modern AI workflows. However, while neural networks may offer slight accuracy benefits, rule-based methods excel in clinical contexts where transparency is critical."
