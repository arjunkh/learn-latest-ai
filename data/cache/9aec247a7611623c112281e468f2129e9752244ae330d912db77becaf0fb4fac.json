    "eli12": "Imagine having a smart assistant that helps you manage your tasks, but instead of making life easier, it creates more confusion. That's what's happening in cybersecurity with AI tools. They can automate decisions, but people still need to keep an eye on everything, which can be exhausting. This matters because it highlights the need for balance between technology and human oversight in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of AI in cybersecurity highlights a critical user need: effective management of automated systems. As these tools become more common, ensuring they donâ€™t overwhelm users is essential for product success. This could mean designing interfaces that simplify oversight or providing better training for users. Addressing this challenge could lead to more sustainable use of AI in security.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the integration of AI in cybersecurity involves complex models that automate threat detection and response. However, as these systems become more prevalent, engineers must consider the cognitive load on users monitoring these automated processes. Balancing automation with user control is crucial, as failure to do so could lead to oversight errors and increased incidents of burnout among cybersecurity professionals."
