    "eli12": "Think of Atlas like a helpful friend who sits beside you while you browse the internet. This friend can answer questions and provide insights as you explore different websites. It matters because it could make finding information easier and more engaging for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Atlas highlights a growing user need for seamless AI integration in everyday tools. This could lead to increased efficiency in tasks like research and content discovery. A practical takeaway is to consider how AI features can enhance existing products or create new user experiences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Atlas integrates ChatGPT directly into the browsing experience, leveraging natural language processing to assist users. While specific benchmarks for performance and user engagement are not detailed, the model's ability to understand context could enhance web interactions. However, the lack of clarity about its primary use case is a key consideration."
