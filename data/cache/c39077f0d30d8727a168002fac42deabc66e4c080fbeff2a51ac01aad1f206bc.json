  "speedrun": "Credit risk models can perform well initially but often falter after a few months due to changing economic conditions or borrower behavior. For example, a model may accurately predict defaults during stable times but struggle when market conditions shift. Understanding why this happens is crucial for lenders to maintain accurate assessments and minimize risk. As financial environments change, ensuring models adapt is more important than ever.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Lenders rely on accurate credit risk models to make informed decisions, impacting their bottom line and customer trust.",
    "Fluctuating economic conditions could lead to a broader trend where financial institutions must continuously update their models to mitigate risk."

    "eli12": "When a credit risk model works well today but fails later, it’s like a weather forecast that’s spot on for a week but misses a sudden storm. This happens because borrower behavior and the economy can change quickly. For everyday people, this means that lenders might be less reliable if they don’t keep their models updated, which could affect loan approvals and interest rates.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this highlights the need for ongoing model evaluation and adjustment. As user behavior shifts, the tools used to assess credit risk must evolve to stay relevant. This could mean investing in more dynamic models or updating existing ones frequently to ensure they meet user needs effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, credit risk models often use historical data to predict future defaults, but this data can become outdated. Models need to be recalibrated regularly to account for new trends and economic changes. A failure to do so can lead to inaccurate risk assessments, potentially causing significant financial losses."
