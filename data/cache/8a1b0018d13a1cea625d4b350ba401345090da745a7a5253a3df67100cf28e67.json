    "eli12": "Imagine trying to bake a cake with ingredients scattered all over the kitchen. Connected data ecosystems are like organizing those ingredients, making it easier to find and use them. This matters for everyday people because better data management can lead to improved services and products that make life easier.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, building connected data ecosystems addresses user needs for seamless experiences. It could lower costs by reducing data redundancy and improving efficiency. Practically, this means faster product iterations and more informed decision-making based on comprehensive data insights.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, connected data ecosystems leverage APIs and data integration tools to unify disparate data sources. This can enhance model training efficiency, allowing for more accurate AI outputs. However, challenges like data privacy and security must be carefully managed to ensure compliance."
