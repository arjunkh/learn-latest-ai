  "speedrun": "In 2025, the cybersecurity landscape is shifting towards ethical practices in response to ransomware attacks like Akira and Ryuk. Customers are increasingly demanding not just stronger defenses, but also ethical containment features that balance security with user needs. This change reflects a broader understanding that effective cybersecurity must consider both protection and the ethical implications of aggressive measures. As organizations adapt, this could redefine how they approach security in a more user-focused way.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations facing ransomware threats need to balance security with ethical practices, ensuring user trust while defending against attacks.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend where ethical considerations in cybersecurity could lead to more sustainable and user-friendly security solutions."

    "eli12": "Think of cybersecurity like a fortress. Instead of just building higher walls, companies are now focusing on how to protect people inside without making them feel trapped. This means creating security measures that are not only strong but also considerate of users’ needs. It matters because a safer, more ethical approach could lead to better experiences for everyone online.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this shift means that user needs are becoming just as important as security features. Companies might need to invest in developing ethical containment options that protect users while still being effective against threats. This could lead to new product opportunities and a more balanced approach to cybersecurity.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the focus is moving from purely defensive measures to integrating ethical considerations into security protocols. This could involve developing systems that not only block threats but also minimize disruption to users. Engineers might explore new models that balance aggressive containment with user experience, ensuring robust protection without compromising ethical standards."
