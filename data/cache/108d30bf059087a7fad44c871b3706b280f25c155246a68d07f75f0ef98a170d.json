    "eli12": "The UN climate talks this year faced intense heat and flooding in Brazil, which made it hard for leaders to negotiate. Imagine trying to have an important conversation during a storm. This situation shows how real climate change is and why we need to take action seriously for our future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the lack of fossil fuel commitments at the climate talks could signal a shift in market dynamics. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, there's an opportunity to innovate sustainable solutions. Focusing on eco-friendly products could meet user demands while reducing long-term costs.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the UN climate talks showcased the ongoing struggle to integrate fossil fuel discussions into climate policy frameworks. The extreme weather events serve as a real-time benchmark for climate resilience. However, the failure to address fossil fuels may limit the effectiveness of proposed solutions, highlighting a gap in current climate strategies."
