    "eli12": "Exciting new techniques in topic modeling are emerging for 2026. Think of seeded modeling as planting seeds in a garden; it helps shape the topics that grow from the data. By integrating large language models, these tools could help us understand text more deeply. This matters because clearer insights from data can improve decision-making in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, these new topic modeling techniques could enhance user experience by providing more relevant content recommendations. The integration of LLMs may reduce costs associated with manual data analysis while increasing efficiency. This means products could become smarter and more user-friendly, ultimately driving engagement.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, seeded modeling and LLM integration represent significant advancements in NLP capabilities. These methods could improve topic coherence and relevance, especially when trained on summarized datasets. By leveraging LLMs, systems may achieve better performance benchmarks in topic identification tasks, making them more effective in real-world applications."
