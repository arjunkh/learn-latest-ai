We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \\emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored whether large language models (LLMs) act as rational agents in decision-making. Researchers examined their ability to maximize utility and maintain coherent beliefs, especially in medical diagnostics. The findings suggest that LLMs may not always align with ideal Bayesian utility maximization, raising questions about their reliability in high-stakes situations. This matters now as LLMs are increasingly used in critical areas, emphasizing the need for understanding their decision-making processes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Medical professionals relying on LLMs could face challenges if these models do not consistently represent rational decision-making.",
    "The study indicates a broader concern for industries using LLMs, as it highlights potential gaps in their decision-making reliability."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how well large language models make decisions, especially in important fields like healthcare. Think of it like checking if a GPS gives reliable directions; if it doesn’t, you might end up lost. Understanding how these models think is crucial for everyone since they affect decisions that can impact lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the need to assess LLMs' decision-making accuracy, especially in sensitive applications like healthcare. If models don’t reliably maximize utility, it could affect user trust and product effectiveness. Ensuring LLMs align with rational decision-making could improve their adoption and reliability in critical sectors.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study investigates LLMs' alignment with Bayesian utility maximization, examining their probability outputs against observed actions. It establishes falsifiable conditions to test the coherence of LLM beliefs, which could inform model design and evaluation. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing more reliable AI systems in high-stakes environments."
