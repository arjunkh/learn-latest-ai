    "eli12": "Climate news in 2025 shows alarming trends, with emissions at record levels and extreme weather causing destruction. It's like a warning bell ringing louder, signaling that our planet is in trouble. For everyday people, this means more frequent and severe weather events that could impact daily life, from food availability to safety.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise in climate-related disasters signals a growing user need for sustainable solutions. Companies focusing on eco-friendly products could see increased demand as consumers become more conscious of climate issues. This shift may also drive innovation in green technologies, presenting new market opportunities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the record-high greenhouse gas emissions reflect ongoing challenges in energy efficiency and carbon capture technologies. Current models suggest that without significant advancements, we may not meet international climate targets. Engineers will need to prioritize innovative solutions to mitigate these emissions and adapt to the increasing frequency of climate-related disasters."
