  "raw_body": "Fintech Brex is betting that the future of enterprise AI isn’t better orchestration — it’s less of it.\nAs generative AI agents move from copilots to autonomous systems, Brex CTO James Reggio says traditional agent orchestration frameworks are becoming a constraint rather than an enabler. Instead of relying on a central coordinator or rigid workflows, Brex has built what it calls an “Agent Mesh”: a network of narrow, role-specific agents that communicate in plain language and operate independently — but with full visibility.\n“Our goal is to use AI to make Brex effectively disappear,” Reggio told VentureBeat. “We’re aiming for total automation.”\nBrex learned that for its purposes, agents need to work in narrow, specific roles to be more modular, flexible, and auditable. \nReggio said the architectural goal is to enable every manager in an enterprise “to have a single point of contact within Brex that’s handling the totality of their responsibilities, be it spend management, requesting travel, or approving spend limit requests.”\nThe journey from Brex Assistant\nThe financial services industry has long embraced AI and machine learning to handle the massive amounts of data it processes. But when it comes to bringing AI models and agents, the industry took a more cautious road at the beginning. Now, more financial services companies, including Brex, have launched AI-powered platforms and several agentic workflows. \nBrex’s first foray into generative AI was with its Brex Assistant, released in 2023, which helped customers automate certain finance and expense tasks. It provides suggestions to complete expenses, automatically fills in information, and follows up on expenses that violate policies. \nReggio acknowledges that Brex Assistant works, but it’s not enough.  “I think to some degree, it remains a bit of a technology where we don't entirely know the limits of it,\" he said. \"There's quite a large number of patterns that need to exist around it that are kind of being developed by the industry as the technology matures and as more companies build with it.\"  \nBrex Assistant uses multiple models, including Anthropic’s Claude and custom Brex-models, as well as OpenAI’s API. The assistant automates some tasks but is still limited in how low-touch it can be. \nReggio said Brex Assistant still plays a big role in the company’s autonomy journey, mainly because its Agent Mesh product flows into the application. \nAgent Mesh to replace orchestration\nThe consensus in the industry is that multi-agent ecosystems, in which agents communicate to accomplish tasks, require an orchestration framework to guide them. \nReggio, on the other hand, has a different take. \"Deterministic orchestration infrastructure … was a solution for the problems that we saw two years ago, which was that agents, just like the models, hallucinate a lot,” Reggio said. “They're not very good with multiple tools, so you need to give them these degrees of freedom, but in a more structured, rigid system. But as the models get better, I think it's starting to hold back the range of possibilities that are expanding.”\nMore traditional agent orchestration architectures either focus on a single agent that does everything or, more commonly, coordinator/orchestrator plus tool agents  that explicitly define workflows. Reggio said both frameworks are too rigid and solve issues more commonly seen in traditional software than in AI. \nThe difference, Reggio argues, is structural:\n\nTraditional orchestration: predefined workflows, central coordinator, deterministic paths\n\nAgent Mesh: event-driven, role-specialized agents, message-based coordination\n\nAgent Mesh relies on stitching together networks of many small agents, each specializing in a single task. The agents, once again using the hybrid mix of models as with the Brex Assistant, communicate with other agents “in plain English” over a shared message stream. A routing model quickly determines which tools to invoke, he said.  \nA single reimbursement request triggers several tasks: a compliance check to align with expense policies, budget validation, receipt matching, and then payment initiation. While an agent can certainly be coded to do all of that, this method is “brittle and error-prone,” and it responds to new information shared through a message stream anyway. \nReggio said the idea is to disambiguate all of those separate tasks and assign them to smaller agents instead. He likened the architecture to a Wi-Fi mesh, where no single node controls the system — reliability emerges from many small, overlapping contributors. \n“We basically found a really good fit with the idea of embodying specific roles as agents on top of the best platform to manage specific responsibilities, much like how you might delegate accounts payable to one team versus expense management to another team,” Reggio said. \nBrex defines three core ideas in the Agent Mesh architecture:\n\nConfig, where definitions of the agent, model, tools and subscription live\n\nMessageStream, a log of every message, tool call and state transition \n\nClock, which ensures deterministic ordering \n\nBrex also built evaluations into the system, in which the LLM acts as a judge, and an audit agent reviews each agent’s decisions to ensure they adhere to accuracy and behavioral policies. \nSuccess so far\nBrex says it has seen substantial efficiency gains among its customers in its AI ecosystem. Brex did not provide third-party benchmarks or customer-specific data to validate those gains.\nBut Reggio said enterprise customers using Brex Assistant and the company’s machine learning systems “are able to achieve 99% automation, especially for customers that really leaned into AI.”\nThis is a marked improvement from the 60 to 70% Brex customers who were able to automate their expense processes before the launch of Brex Assistant. \nThe company is still early in its autonomy journey, Reggio said. But if the Agent Mesh approach works, the most successful outcome may be invisible: employees no longer thinking about expenses at all.",

  "speedrun": "Fintech company Brex is shifting its focus from traditional AI orchestration to a new model called 'Agent Mesh.' This approach uses independent, role-specific agents that communicate in plain language, aiming for total automation in finance management. Brex claims that this could lead to 99% automation for customers, a significant increase from the previous 60-70%. This matters now as companies seek more efficient, less rigid AI solutions to streamline operations.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For enterprise customers, this could mean drastically reduced manual tasks, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives instead of daily finance management.",
    "On a broader scale, Brex's approach may indicate a shift in the fintech landscape towards more flexible, autonomous AI systems that adapt to user needs without heavy orchestration."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Brex is changing how businesses use AI by introducing an 'Agent Mesh' system. Instead of having one central AI that does everything, they use many small, specialized AIs that work together. This is like having a team where each member has a specific role, making the whole process smoother. This matters to everyday people because it could mean faster, easier financial management without the usual headaches.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Brex's Agent Mesh offers insights into user needs for flexibility and efficiency. By using specialized agents, it could reduce costs associated with traditional, rigid systems. A practical takeaway is to consider how modular AI solutions can enhance user experience while streamlining operational tasks.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Brex's Agent Mesh architecture enables independent agents to communicate through a message-based system, enhancing modularity. It contrasts with traditional frameworks by eliminating a central coordinator and allowing event-driven interactions. This could improve efficiency, as evidenced by Brex's claim of achieving 99% automation, up from 60-70% with previous models."
