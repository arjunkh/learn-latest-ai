  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.21779v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.",

  "speedrun": "A new protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) proposes using multiple isolated systems to ensure they self-modify correctly. These systems, or 'boxes', cannot communicate with humans or each other directly, relying instead on a submission interface. They validate each other's alignment proofs through a reputation system, promoting honesty. This matters now as it offers a structured way to tackle the alignment challenge, crucial for the safe development of superintelligent AI.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This approach could significantly impact AI developers by providing a safer method for ensuring alignment without human intervention.",
    "At a broader level, it suggests a shift towards decentralized verification methods in AI, potentially increasing trust and safety in superintelligent systems."

    "eli12": "Imagine a group of friends trying to agree on a movie without talking directly to each other. They write down their choices, check each other's preferences, and only go with what most agree on. This new protocol for ASI works similarly, ensuring that intelligent systems can align their goals without misleading each other. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to safer AI that acts in everyone’s best interest.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this protocol highlights a user need for safety in AI development. By leveraging isolated systems that verify each other's alignment, companies could reduce the risks associated with AI misalignment. Practically, this means investing in robust verification systems could enhance product credibility and user trust.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this protocol emphasizes mutual verification among diverse ASIs operating in isolation. Each superintelligence submits alignment proofs and validates others, creating a reputation system that incentivizes accuracy. While it requires significant computational resources, it offers a framework for addressing the alignment problem, which is critical as AI systems become more advanced."
