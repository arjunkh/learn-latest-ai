  "speedrun": "A recent article argues that achieving 90% accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems is insufficient for practical use. The reasoning is that even small errors can lead to significant misunderstandings in data queries. This matters because businesses rely on precise data analytics, and inaccuracies could skew decision-making processes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For data analysts, even a slight error in query results could lead to flawed insights, impacting their work directly.",
    "At a market level, this highlights a need for more reliable AI tools, pushing companies to invest in improving accuracy for better decision-making."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to follow a recipe with instructions that are 90% correct. You might end up with a dish that doesn't taste right. This is similar to Text-to-SQL systems where minor inaccuracies can lead to major mistakes in data analysis. It’s important for everyday people because unreliable data can affect services and products they use daily.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding that 90% accuracy in Text-to-SQL could lead to user frustration is crucial. Users need tools that provide reliable insights without the risk of misinterpretation. This could influence product development priorities toward improving accuracy and user trust.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, achieving 90% accuracy in Text-to-SQL might involve using advanced models like BERT or GPT. However, the article emphasizes that even small inaccuracies can lead to incorrect data retrieval, which is critical for applications relying on precise data. Engineers must focus on enhancing model robustness to ensure reliability."
