  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.02641v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored the practical deployment of on-device AI models for translating live-stream chat on mobile devices. Researchers created a benchmark called LiveChatBench, consisting of 1,000 Korean-English sentence pairs, to test model performance. Their findings show that well-chosen on-device models can match the performance of commercial models like GPT-5.1, despite the constraints of mobile devices. This research is crucial as it could enhance real-time communication in diverse user settings.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This study provides insights for developers creating translation tools, potentially improving communication for users in multilingual environments.",
    "It signals a shift towards more efficient, on-device AI solutions, which could reduce reliance on cloud services and enhance user privacy."

    "eli12": "This research looks at how mobile devices can translate chat messages in real time. By testing different models, the study shows that it's possible to get good results without needing powerful servers. This matters for everyday people because it could make chatting with friends who speak different languages much easier and faster.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this study highlights the importance of model selection in on-device applications. Efficient translation can improve user experience while reducing costs associated with data transfer. A practical takeaway is to consider on-device solutions for real-time features, which could enhance user engagement.",
    "engineer": "The study investigates CPU utilization and thermal conditions for on-device AI models, focusing on the translation of live-stream chat. By developing LiveChatBench with 1,000 sentence pairs, the research demonstrates that selected on-device models can achieve performance similar to GPT-5.1. This suggests that with careful model selection, on-device AI can be both efficient and effective in real-world applications."
