    "eli12": "Imagine asking a crowd how they want a robot to behave, then programming it based on their answers. OpenAI's survey aims to do just that, ensuring AI reflects a variety of human values. This matters because it helps make AI more relatable and acceptable for everyone, not just a select few.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding user expectations from this survey can guide AI design choices. It highlights the need for products that resonate with diverse audiences, potentially improving user satisfaction. Aligning with collective values could also enhance brand reputation in an increasingly competitive market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this survey's results provide valuable data points for refining AI models. By integrating public feedback into the Model Spec, engineers can adjust algorithms to prioritize behaviors that reflect a broader range of human values. However, the challenge lies in balancing these diverse inputs while maintaining model performance."
