    "eli12": "Flow Matching is like having many ears listening at once, each trying to understand what someone is saying. This helps computers better recognize different accents, especially in loud places. For everyday users, this means smoother conversations with voice assistants and other tech.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Flow Matching addresses a key user need: accurate speech recognition across diverse accents. This could lead to more efficient interactions with voice-driven products, ultimately lowering user frustration and improving retention rates. It's a step toward more inclusive technology.",
    "engineer": "Flow Matching leverages multiple probabilistic outputs to enhance speech generation accuracy. This method is particularly effective in challenging acoustic environments, making it easier to recognize accents. As AI models evolve, integrating such techniques could improve overall performance benchmarks in speech recognition tasks."
