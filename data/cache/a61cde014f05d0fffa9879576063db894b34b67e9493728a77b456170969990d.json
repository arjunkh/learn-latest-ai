  "speedrun": "Cohere, an AI startup, has recently raised its valuation but is not growing as fast as its competitors. While this might seem concerning, Cohere's specific focus could align well with what businesses need. Their slower growth might actually indicate a more strategic approach. This situation highlights the evolving landscape of AI, where quality and targeted solutions could be more valuable than sheer speed.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Cohere's slower growth could signal to enterprises that a thoughtful approach to AI is essential, prioritizing long-term solutions over rapid expansion.",
    "This trend suggests a shift in the AI market, where companies may prioritize depth and specialization rather than just competing for speed."

    "eli12": "Cohere is taking its time to grow, which might sound odd in a fast-paced world. Think of it like a chef who takes longer to prepare a meal, ensuring every ingredient is perfect. This could mean better results for businesses looking for reliable AI solutions, making it relevant for everyday users who want dependable technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Cohere's approach highlights the importance of focusing on user needs rather than just rapid growth. This could mean investing in quality and tailored solutions, which might lead to better user satisfaction. It suggests that a slower, more deliberate strategy might be a viable path in the competitive AI landscape.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Cohere's slower growth might suggest a focus on refining their models rather than racing to release new features. This could allow them to optimize performance and reliability, which are crucial for enterprise applications. However, the challenge remains to balance innovation speed with delivering robust solutions."
