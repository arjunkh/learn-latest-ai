  "speedrun": "Enterprises are shifting towards on-demand digital services for computing and storage, aiming for faster deployment and better integration. However, the network infrastructure remains largely rigid, with many organizations still relying on traditional, pre-provisioned systems. This disconnect could hinder their agility in a rapidly evolving API economy. Addressing this network challenge is crucial for enterprises to fully leverage their digital transformation efforts.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations looking to innovate quickly face limitations due to outdated network systems, impacting their ability to compete effectively.",
    "The broader market is moving towards more flexible digital services, highlighting a need for networks that can support this shift and enhance overall enterprise agility."

    "eli12": "More companies are opting for flexible digital services that can be quickly launched and easily expanded. Think of it like ordering food online—it's convenient and fast. But if the delivery service is slow or unreliable, it ruins the experience. Improving network flexibility is essential for businesses to keep up with customer demands and stay competitive.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend signals a critical need to prioritize network flexibility in product design. Users expect seamless and rapid service delivery, which can be hindered by outdated network infrastructure. Emphasizing agile networking solutions could enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, many enterprises are still using rigid, pre-provisioned networks, despite advancements in software-defined networking. This limitation can slow down deployment and integration of digital services. Engineers may need to advocate for more adaptable network solutions to align with the increasing demand for agility in the API economy."
