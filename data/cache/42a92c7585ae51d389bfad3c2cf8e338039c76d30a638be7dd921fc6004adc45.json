Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally, models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others' existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition. We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop appropriate AI self-awareness.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights that many AI models struggle with self-recognition, a key aspect of their metacognitive abilities. In tests involving 10 large language models, only 4 accurately identified their own text, with most performing at random chance levels. This finding is significant as it raises concerns about AI safety and the reliability of these systems in evaluative tasks. Understanding self-recognition could help improve AI development and ensure safer interactions with users.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This issue is crucial for developers and users who rely on AI for accurate evaluations, as poor self-recognition could lead to flawed outputs.",
    "At a broader level, the findings indicate a need for improved AI design, potentially reshaping how we approach AI safety and functionality in various applications."

    "eli12": "This research shows that many AI systems can't recognize their own work, which is a bit like a student not knowing their own handwriting. If AI can't tell what it has created, it might make mistakes that confuse users. This matters because as more people use AI, we need to ensure they can trust what it produces.",
    "pm": "For product managers, these findings suggest that user trust in AI outputs could be at risk if models fail to recognize their own content. This could lead to inefficiencies or errors in applications relying on AI for content generation. Enhancing self-recognition could improve product reliability and user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this study evaluated 10 large language models on their self-recognition capabilities through binary tasks. The results showed that only 40% of the models could identify their own outputs, often favoring outputs from GPT and Claude models. This highlights a significant gap in current AI self-awareness that engineers need to address to enhance model reliability."
