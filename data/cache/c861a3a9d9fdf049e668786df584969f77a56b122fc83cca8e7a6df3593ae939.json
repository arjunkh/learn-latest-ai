    "eli12": "Think of training a neural network like teaching a child to ride a bike. By measuring progress every few pedaling steps, we can see what works and what doesn't. This helps improve the learning process. For everyday people, better-trained AI could lead to smarter apps and tools in daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this analysis highlights the importance of tracking user behavior closely. Just as monitoring each step in training can lead to improvements, understanding user interactions can enhance product efficiency. This could result in more responsive features that meet user needs effectively.",
    "engineer": "The analysis utilized detailed performance metrics every five steps over 10,000 iterations, allowing for granular insights into training dynamics. Such measurements can reveal critical patterns in loss and accuracy, which are essential for optimizing model performance. However, the article does not mention specific models or benchmarks, leaving room for further exploration."
