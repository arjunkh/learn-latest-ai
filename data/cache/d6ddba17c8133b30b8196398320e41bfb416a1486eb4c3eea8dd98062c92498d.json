  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.09932v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of \"being together\" enhances communication. An \"Embodied Information Hub\" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces Suzume-chan, an AI agent designed as an 'Embodied Information Hub' to enhance knowledge sharing through physical interaction and conversation. This prototype utilizes a local language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide real-time responses based on spoken explanations. By fostering a sense of connection, it aims to make the transfer of expert knowledge feel more human and engaging. This approach could reshape how we access and understand complex information.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Suzume-chan could significantly benefit educators and learners by creating a more engaging and interactive learning environment.",
    "This development may signal a shift in digital tools towards prioritizing emotional connection, potentially enhancing user experience across various fields."

    "eli12": "Imagine having a friendly robot that helps you learn, just like a buddy explaining things to you. Suzume-chan is designed to make understanding complex topics feel more personal and connected. This matters because it could change how we interact with technology, making learning less intimidating and more relatable for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, Suzume-chan highlights the importance of user engagement through emotional connection. By addressing the need for warmth in digital interactions, it could lead to more effective educational tools. This shift might also reduce costs associated with traditional learning methods by providing immediate, personalized support.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Suzume-chan employs a local language model combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to facilitate real-time dialogue. This approach allows it to learn from user interactions, enhancing its ability to respond accurately. The focus on reducing psychological distance in communication may require further exploration of user feedback for optimization."
