  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.21320v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called LINKO has been introduced to improve how medical concepts are represented in electronic health records. By using large language models, LINKO allows for dual-axis knowledge propagation, integrating information from multiple ontology systems simultaneously. This method enhances the understanding of medical concepts by linking related ideas across different categories. Its significance lies in its ability to improve predictions, especially in cases with limited data or rare diseases.",

    "eli12": "LINKO is like a translator that connects different languages of medical knowledge. Instead of just translating one language at a time, it understands and relates multiple languages simultaneously. This could help doctors make better decisions by providing a clearer picture of a patient's health. Improved data representation matters because it could lead to better treatment outcomes for patients.",
    "pm": "For product managers, LINKO represents a way to enhance existing electronic health record systems. By integrating multiple ontology systems, it addresses user needs for comprehensive data insights. This could lead to cost savings in data processing and improved efficiency in healthcare delivery. The practical implication is that EHR systems could become more effective tools for healthcare providers.",
    "engineer": "Technically, LINKO employs a dual-axis approach for knowledge propagation, enhancing concept representation learning across multiple ontology graphs. It uses large language models to initialize concept embeddings and performs vertical and horizontal propagation within and across hierarchical levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate LINKO's superior performance compared to existing models, particularly in scenarios with sparse data and rare disease predictions."
