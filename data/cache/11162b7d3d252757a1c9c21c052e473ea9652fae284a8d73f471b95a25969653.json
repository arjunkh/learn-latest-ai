  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.08088v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18 repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition, document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem.",

  "speedrun": "EnvX introduces a new framework that turns GitHub repositories into intelligent agents using Agentic AI. This approach enables repositories to autonomously perform tasks and collaborate with one another, addressing the manual and error-prone nature of current software reuse. In testing, EnvX achieved a 74.07% execution completion rate and a 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing solutions. This innovation could significantly enhance the efficiency of software development and collaboration in open-source projects.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers could streamline their workflows, reducing time spent on manual integration and error correction with EnvX's autonomous agents.",
    "This shift towards intelligent software components may reshape the open-source landscape, making it easier for teams to collaborate and innovate."

    "eli12": "EnvX is like turning a library of books into a team of knowledgeable librarians who can help you find and use information. Instead of manually searching through code, developers can interact with these agents to get tasks done efficiently. This matters because it makes software development smoother and faster for everyone, especially those who may not be experts.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, EnvX addresses a critical user need by simplifying the integration of reusable software components. This could reduce costs and improve efficiency in product development. By enabling autonomous agents to handle tasks, teams could focus more on innovation rather than integration challenges.",
