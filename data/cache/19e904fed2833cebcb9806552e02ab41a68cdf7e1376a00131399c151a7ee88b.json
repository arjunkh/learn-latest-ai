We can also map findings to compliance frameworks (OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, etc.) if that's useful. All we need is access to an endpoint and permission to use your anonymized results as a case study. The whole process takes about 2-3 weeks. If you're running AI/LLM systems in production and want a security review, shoot me a DM.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45009940\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

    "eli12": "Imagine a team of detectives checking your house for hidden weaknesses before a burglar strikes. This AI red teaming platform does just that for companies using AI, helping them find and fix security issues. It's important because as more businesses rely on AI, keeping it safe is essential for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this platform offers a chance to ensure their AI products are secure before they face real-world threats. By participating, companies can gain valuable insights into vulnerabilities, giving them a competitive edge. A practical next step is to reach out and explore this testing opportunity.",
    "engineer": "This platform focuses on identifying critical vulnerabilities in AI systems, such as prompt injection and document upload attacks. It promises comprehensive reports with specific fixes, but the effectiveness will depend on the thoroughness of the testing. Companies should consider how these findings align with existing compliance frameworks."
