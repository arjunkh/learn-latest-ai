    "eli12": "The article breaks down Kernel SVM, a complex machine learning method, into simpler parts. Think of it like building a cake layer by layer, where each layer is essential for the final taste. This matters because it helps everyday people understand how machines learn from data without getting lost in technical jargon.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this breakdown of Kernel SVM highlights the importance of making complex technologies more user-friendly. By focusing on essential data points, teams could improve model efficiency and user experience. This could lead to more effective product features that leverage machine learning without overwhelming users.",
    "engineer": "The article presents Kernel SVM as a composition of local kernels, emphasizing the role of hinge loss in selecting critical data points. This method contrasts with traditional SVM approaches that can be more abstract. By simplifying the construction process, it allows engineers to better visualize and implement SVM models, potentially improving model performance and interpretability."
