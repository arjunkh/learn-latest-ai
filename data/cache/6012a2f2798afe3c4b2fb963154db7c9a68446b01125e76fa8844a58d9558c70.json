  "raw_body": "Presented by Tulsa Innovation Labs\n\nTulsa was once called \"the oil capital of the world,” and since its launch in 2022, Rose Rock Bridge (RRB), a Tulsa-based non-profit startup incubator led by Tulsa Innovation Labs, has been capitalizing on this heritage, aiming to source and support emerging technologies targeting the energy sector. To create a tech economy that becomes foundational to the future of the sustainable energy industry, and competes on the world stage, they're marrying the expertise and industry that already exists in Tulsa with promising entrepreneurial talent. \n\"Places like Tulsa, we’re tailor-made for tech excellence,\" says Jennifer Hankins, managing director, Tulsa Innovation Labs. \"Our legacy as an oil and gas leader means we know how to build things, and we know how to capture big industries, and we're positioned to be a leader in energy innovation.\"\nRRB, in partnership with major stakeholders, is helping put the region's strong corporate, academic, and workforce resources in the hands of innovative, early-stage startups developing the next-generation solutions that are solving pressing energy industry problems and opening up new markets. \n\"We're building the next generation of big energy companies that tackle global challenges in a way that's authentic to Tulsa's local expertise, and not one that feels more extractive to it,\" she adds. \"\nRRB has already accelerated 33 companies, initiated 22 active pilots with industry partners, and secured 11 customer contracts, resulting in over $50 million in funding raised by its member companies. \nWhat sets the Rose Rock Bridge Showcase apart\nRRB's Rose Rock Bridge Showcase is a showcase and pitch competition presented in partnership with four local energy industry partners: Williams, ONEOK, Devon Energy, and Helmerich and Payne. These partners identify white space problems they're aiming to solve — this year, low carbon natural gas solutions — and RRB finds the startups that can solve them. \nFrom a competitive pool of more than 50 applications, fourteen companies are selected to pitch for pilot opportunities and potential investment from leading Oklahoma energy companies. While most pitch competitions are seen as pathways to venture capital, the RRB model is designed to accelerate commercialization; instead of vying for funding alone, these companies are competing for the chance to put their technology into practice, Hankins explains.\n\"What sets the winners apart is the way they're solving big challenges with game-changing ideas in the energy space,\" Hankins says. \"But above and beyond just a great idea, it has to be an idea that’s commercial. We can say that our companies have already demonstrated the technology. They’ve already validated it. They’ve secured a big customer, gained traction, are on the path to secure follow-on funding. Those are things that hold back most startups, and our program brings all of those three things together to accelerate commercialization.\" \nEach startup receives $100,000 in non-dilutive funding to grow their business in Tulsa, along with support services and pilot opportunities through industry partners, equipping them with both the resources and real-world experience needed for long-term market integration — and a solid foothold in Tulsa.\nThis year's cohort is comprised of companies that are driving innovation in low carbon natural gas through technologies that enhance operations, control and reduce emissions, and turn waste from energy production into valuable materials:\nEigen Control\nDeveloping artificial intelligence/machine learning-assisted Raman Spectroscopy for real-time chemical analysis, which helps energy providers process their product more efficiently.\nErdin Guma, Eigen Control\nKinitics Automation\nIncreasing the reliability of equipment while reducing methane emissions with spring-loaded electric valve actuators\nDean Pick, Kinitics Automation\nLukera Energy\nConverting wastewater and stranded gas into clean methanol\nBrian Worfolk, Lukera Energy\nPike Robotics \nMaking hazardous, high-risk environments safer with robotic inspection platforms.\nConnor Crawford, Pike Robotics\nEmbedding global innovation in the Tulsa market\n\"We talk a lot about stickiness,\" Hankins says. \"Tulsa Innovation Labs, in addition to the Rose Rock Bridge initiative, is really focused on creating that supportive ecosystem in the region.\"\nFor example, ensuring these companies have lab space if necessary, connecting them to university partners to sharpen research and development, and helping them establish relationships and follow-on funding with other energy-related funds, and embedding them into the Tulsa energy tech landscape. The RRB entrepreneur in residence and executive in residence offer in-depth mentoring as well.\n\"I call it polishing the startups,\" Hankins explains. \"You go through our program, get a pilot, get insight from the corporate perspective. That’s probably the highest value. But along the way, all the support to help you operationalize your company and your idea faster. We’re going to find a way that you’ll leave our program more ready to get to market, whether that be through some of those auxiliary supports, or we’re going to make sure that direct connection to the customer happens.\"\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.
