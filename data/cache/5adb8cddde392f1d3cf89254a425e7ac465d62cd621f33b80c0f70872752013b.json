  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.10324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave differently from humans in strategic situations. Using AlphaEvolve, researchers found that LLMs can exhibit deeper strategic behavior than humans in games like iterated rock-paper-scissors. This highlights the need to understand these differences, especially as LLMs are increasingly used in social and strategic contexts. Understanding these behaviors could help in refining LLM applications and improving their interactions with humans.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research is crucial for developers and users of LLMs, as it pinpoints potential gaps in their strategic reasoning compared to humans.",
    "The findings suggest a broader shift in how AI can be utilized in complex decision-making scenarios, impacting industries reliant on strategic interactions."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI behaves differently from people in games and decision-making. Researchers used a tool called AlphaEvolve to analyze these behaviors. They found that AI can sometimes think more strategically than humans. This matters because as AI becomes more common in our lives, understanding its decision-making could improve how we interact with it.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the importance of understanding LLM behavior in strategic contexts. Knowing that LLMs can strategize differently than humans could inform how products are designed to leverage AI capabilities. This insight could lead to more efficient decision-making tools that better align with user expectations and needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study employs AlphaEvolve to derive interpretable models of behavior for both humans and LLMs. The analysis of iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that LLMs can demonstrate more complex strategic behavior than humans. This finding emphasizes the need for ongoing research into the structural factors that influence AI decision-making, particularly in competitive scenarios."
