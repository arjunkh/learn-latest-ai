  "raw_body": "João Freitas is GM and VP of engineering for AI and automation at PagerDuty\nAs AI use continues to evolve in large organizations, leaders are increasingly seeking the next development that will yield major ROI. The latest wave of this ongoing trend is the adoption of AI agents. However, as with any new technology, organizations must ensure they adopt AI agents in a responsible way that allows them to facilitate both speed and security. \nMore than half of organizations have already deployed AI agents to some extent, with more expecting to follow suit in the next two years. But many early adopters are now reevaluating their approach. Four-in-10 tech leaders regret not establishing a stronger governance foundation from the start, which suggests they adopted AI rapidly, but with margin to improve on policies, rules and best practices designed to ensure the responsible, ethical and legal development and use of AI.\nAs AI adoption accelerates, organizations must find the right balance between their exposure risk and the implementation of guardrails to ensure AI use is secure.\nWhere do AI agents create potential risks?\nThere are three principal areas of consideration for safer AI adoption.\nThe first is shadow AI, when employees use unauthorized AI tools without express permission, bypassing approved tools and processes. IT should create necessary processes for experimentation and innovation to introduce more efficient ways of working with AI. While shadow AI has existed as long as AI tools themselves, AI agent autonomy makes it easier for unsanctioned tools to operate outside the purview of IT, which can introduce fresh security risks.\nSecondly, organizations must close gaps in AI ownership and accountability to prepare for incidents or processes gone wrong. The strength of AI agents lies in their autonomy. However, if agents act in unexpected ways, teams must be able to determine who is responsible for addressing any issues.\nThe third risk arises when there is a lack of explainability for actions AI agents have taken. AI agents are goal-oriented, but how they accomplish their goals can be unclear. AI agents must have explainable logic underlying their actions so that engineers can trace and, if needed, roll back actions that may cause issues with existing systems.\nWhile none of these risks should delay adoption, they will help organizations better ensure their security.\nThe three guidelines for responsible AI agent adoption\nOnce organizations have identified the risks AI agents can pose, they must implement guidelines and guardrails to ensure safe usage. By following these three steps, organizations can minimize these risks.\n1: Make human oversight the default \nAI agency continues to evolve at a fast pace. However, we still need human oversight when AI agents are given the  capacity to act, make decisions and pursue a goal that may impact key systems. A human should be in the loop by default, especially for business-critical use cases and systems. The teams that use AI must understand the actions it may take and where they may need to intervene. Start conservatively and, over time, increase the level of agency given to AI agents.\nIn conjunction, operations teams, engineers and security professionals must understand the role they play in supervising AI agents’ workflows. Each agent should be assigned a specific human owner for clearly defined oversight and accountability. Organizations must also allow any human to flag or override an AI agent’s behavior when an action has a negative outcome.\nWhen considering tasks for AI agents, organizations should understand that, while traditional automation is good at handling repetitive, rule-based processes with structured data inputs, AI agents can handle much more complex tasks and adapt to new information in a more autonomous way. This makes them an appealing solution for all sorts of tasks. But as AI agents are deployed, organizations should control what actions the agents can take, particularly in the early stages of a project. Thus, teams working with AI agents should have approval paths in place for high-impact actions to ensure agent scope does not extend beyond expected use cases, minimizing risk to the wider system.\n2: Bake in security \nThe introduction of new tools should not expose a system to fresh security risks. \nOrganizations should consider agentic platforms that comply with high security standards and are validated by enterprise-grade certifications such as SOC2, FedRAMP or equivalent. Further, AI agents should not be allowed free rein across an organization’s systems. At a minimum, the permissions and security scope of an AI agent must be aligned with the scope of the owner, and any tools added to the agent should not allow for extended permissions. Limiting AI agent access to a system based on their role will also ensure deployment runs smoothly. Keeping complete logs of every action taken by an AI agent can also help engineers understand what happened in the event of an incident and trace back the problem.\n3: Make outputs explainable \nAI use in an organization must never be a black box. The reasoning behind any action must be illustrated so that any engineer who tries to access it can understand the context the agent used for decision-making and access the traces that led to those actions.\nInputs and outputs for every action should be logged and accessible. This will help organizations establish a firm overview of the logic underlying an AI agent’s actions, providing significant value in the event anything goes wrong.\nSecurity underscores AI agents’ success\nAI agents offer a huge opportunity for organizations to accelerate and improve their existing processes. However, if they do not prioritize security and strong governance, they could expose themselves to new risks. \nAs AI agents become more common, organizations must ensure they have systems in place to measure how they perform and the ability to take action when they create problems.\nRead more from our guest writers.

  "speedrun": "Organizations are rapidly adopting AI agents to boost efficiency, with over half already using them and many more expected to follow. However, 40% of tech leaders regret not establishing stronger governance from the start, highlighting the need for better policies. As AI agents gain autonomy, they can introduce security risks, making responsible adoption crucial. This is particularly relevant now as companies strive to balance innovation with safety in AI deployment.",

    "eli12": "AI agents are tools that can work autonomously to handle tasks, similar to how a self-driving car navigates without constant input. However, just like we need safety drivers in those cars, organizations need to ensure human oversight when using AI agents. This is important for everyone, as it helps keep systems secure and ensures that AI behaves as expected.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of AI agents presents an opportunity to enhance user experience while managing risks. Understanding user needs for efficiency must be balanced with implementing robust security measures. A practical implication is that teams should establish clear guidelines for AI agent actions to prevent unintended consequences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, organizations must ensure AI agents operate within defined security parameters and maintain logs of their actions. This means using platforms that comply with standards like SOC2 and ensuring agents have limited permissions based on their roles. Clear, explainable outputs are also essential for tracing actions, which can help mitigate risks associated with agent autonomy."
