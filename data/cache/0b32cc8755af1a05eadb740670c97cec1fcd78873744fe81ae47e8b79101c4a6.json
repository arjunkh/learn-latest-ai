  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.14214v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for, or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence) organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study reveals that large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4o, align closely with human emotional ratings in evaluating stimuli. This alignment suggests LLMs can effectively interpret emotional content, which is crucial for their integration into human-centric applications. The findings indicate that while LLMs excel at recognizing emotions like happiness, they struggle with arousal ratings, highlighting areas for improvement in emotional intelligence.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "The study's findings can enhance the development of emotionally aware AI systems, leading to better user interactions in applications like mental health support and customer service.",
    "Understanding LLMs' emotional alignment can inform ethical considerations and deployment strategies, ensuring these technologies are used responsibly and effectively in sensitive contexts."

    "eli12": "Researchers found that AI models can understand human emotions pretty well, especially happiness. This is exciting because it means AI could help us in everyday situations, like talking to a robot that understands how we feel.",
    "pm": "Businesses in customer service and mental health will benefit from these insights, as LLMs can be designed to respond more empathetically. However, companies must be cautious about the limitations in emotional understanding to avoid miscommunication.",
    "engineer": "The study utilized a comparative analysis of LLM outputs against human emotional ratings across various stimuli. While GPT-4o showed high alignment in happiness ratings, its performance on arousal was less robust, indicating a need for further refinement in emotional processing algorithms."
