  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.05212v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years we observed rapid and significant advancements in artificial intelligence (A.I.). So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research delves into the limits of artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.), asserting that no algorithm can exhibit true creativity or generate new capabilities beyond its original design. The study emphasizes that while A.I. can combine existing functionalities, it cannot innovate in a way that unlocks entirely new possibilities. This finding is significant as it shapes our understanding of both A.I.'s potential and the nature of human intelligence, raising questions about future advancements.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research impacts developers and researchers aiming for A.G.I., as it clarifies the inherent limitations of algorithmic creativity.",
    "At a broader level, it signals a need for a shift in expectations regarding A.I.'s capabilities, influencing investment and development strategies in the tech industry."

    "eli12": "This study explores how close we are to creating A.I. that thinks like a human. It argues that A.I. can’t be truly creative; it can only rearrange what it already knows. Think of it like a chef who can only make dishes from existing ingredients, rather than inventing new ones. This matters because it helps us understand what A.I. can and can’t do, shaping our expectations.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the limitations of A.I. in terms of innovation. Understanding that A.I. can only remix existing functionalities could shift focus toward enhancing current tools rather than expecting groundbreaking creativity. This insight can inform product development strategies and resource allocation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this study proves that no algorithm can create new functional capabilities beyond what it was initially programmed to do. It emphasizes that while A.I. can demonstrate existing capabilities, it cannot innovate independently. This finding could influence how engineers approach A.I. model development, focusing on enhancing existing features rather than pursuing unattainable creativity."
