  "speedrun": "The Law Society believes that existing laws are sufficient for the AI era, countering government calls for regulatory changes to hasten AI adoption. They emphasize that lawyers need a better understanding of how current regulations apply to AI. This comes as the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology seeks input for an 'AI Growth Lab' to foster AI deployment. Understanding current laws could streamline AI integration without the need for new regulations.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Lawyers could benefit from clearer guidance on applying existing laws to AI, which would help them navigate this evolving landscape.",
    "This stance suggests a shift towards leveraging current regulations, potentially influencing how AI technologies are developed and deployed across various sectors."

    "eli12": "The Law Society suggests we don't need new rules for AI; we just need to understand the ones we have. Think of it like using a smartphone with the same apps but needing to learn how to use them better. This matters because it could help people use AI responsibly without added confusion from new laws.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this highlights the importance of understanding existing regulations rather than waiting for new ones. It could save time and resources by focusing on compliance with current laws. This approach might lead to faster product development cycles as teams learn to navigate the legal landscape effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the Law Society’s position suggests that AI developers should focus on compliance with existing legal frameworks instead of anticipating new regulations. This could mean utilizing current models and data protection standards to ensure their AI systems are legally sound. It emphasizes the need for engineers to be well-versed in legal implications while developing AI solutions."
