  "raw_body": "It was originally found in leaked code and publicized by AI influencers on X, but OpenAI has made it official: ChatGPT now offers Group Chats, allowing multiple users to join the same, single ChatGPT conversation and send messages to each other and the underlying large language model (LLM), online and via its mobile apps. \nImagine adding ChatGPT as another member of your existing group chats, allowing you to text it as you would one of your friends or family members and have them respond as well, and you'll have an idea of the intriguing power and potential of this feature.\nHowever, the feature is only available as a limited pilot for now to ChatGPT users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan (all tiers, including free usage).\n\n“Group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a shared space to collaborate and interact with others,” OpenAI wrote in its announcement.\n\nThis development builds on internal experimentation at OpenAI, where technical staffer Keyan Zhang said in a post on X that OpenAI's team initially considered multiplayer ChatGPT to be “a wild, out-of-distribution idea.”\nAccording to Zhang, the model’s performance in those early tests demonstrated far more potential than existing interfaces typically allow.\nThe move follows OpenAI investor yet competitor Microsoft's update of its Copilot AI assistant to allow group chats last month, as well as Anthropic's introduction of shareable context and chat histories from its Claude AI models through its Projects feature introduced summer 2024, though this is not a simultaneous, realtime group chat in the same way. \nCollaborative functionality integrated into ChatGPT\nGroup chats function as shared conversational spaces where users can plan events, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate on projects with the added support of ChatGPT. \nThese conversations are distinct from individual chats and are excluded from ChatGPT’s memory system—meaning no data from these group threads is used to train or personalize future interactions.\nUsers can initiate a group chat by selecting the people icon in a new or existing conversation. Adding others creates a copy of the original thread, preserving the source dialogue. Participants can join via a shareable link and are prompted to create a profile with a name, username, and photo. The feature supports 1 to 20 participants per group.\nEach group chat is listed in a new section of the ChatGPT interface, and users can manage settings like naming the group, adding or removing participants, or muting notifications.\nPowered by GPT-5.1 with expanded tools\nThe new group chat feature runs on GPT-5.1 Auto, a backend setting that chooses the optimal model based on the user’s subscription tier and the prompt. \nFunctionality such as search, image generation, file upload, and dictation is available inside group conversations.\nImportantly, the system applies rate limits only when ChatGPT is producing responses. Direct messages between human users in the group do not count toward any plan’s message cap.\nOpenAI has added new social features to ChatGPT in support of this group dynamic. The model can react with emojis, interpret conversational context to decide when to respond, and personalize generated content using members’ profile photos—such as inserting user likenesses into images when asked.\nPrivacy by default, controls for younger users\nOpenAI emphasized that privacy and user control are integral to group chat design. The feature operates independently of the user’s personalized ChatGPT memory, and no new memories are created from these interactions. \nParticipation requires an invitation link, and members are always able to see who is in a chat or leave at any time.\nUsers under the age of 18 are automatically shielded from sensitive content in group chats. Parents or guardians can disable group chat access altogether via built-in parental controls.\nGroup creators retain special permissions, including immunity from being removed by others. All other participants can be added or removed by group members.\nA testbed for shared AI experiences\nOpenAI frames group chats as an early step toward richer, multi-user applications of AI, hinting at broader ambitions for ChatGPT as a shared workspace. The company expects to expand access over time and refine the feature based on how early users engage with it.\nKeyan Zhang’s post suggests that the underlying model capabilities are far ahead of the interfaces users currently interact with. This pilot, in OpenAI’s view, offers a new “container” where more of the model’s latent capacity can be surfaced.\n\n“Our models have a lot more room to shine than today’s experiences show, and the current containers only use a fraction of their capabilities,” Zhang said.\n\nWith this initial pilot focused on a limited set of markets, OpenAI is likely monitoring both usage patterns and cultural fit as it plans for broader deployment. For now, the group chat experiment offers a new way for users to interact with ChatGPT—and with each other—in real time, using a conversational interface that blends productivity and personalization.\nDeveloper access: Still unclear\nOpenAI has not provided any indication that Group Chats will be accessible via the API or SDK. The current rollout is framed strictly within the ChatGPT product environment, with no mention of tool calls, developer hooks, or integration support for programmatic use. This absence of signaling leaves it unclear whether the company views group interaction as a future developer primitive or as a contained UX feature for end users only.\nFor enterprise teams exploring how to replicate multi-user collaboration with generative models, any current implementation would require custom orchestration—such as managing multi-party context and prompts across separate API calls, and handling session state and response merging externally. Until OpenAI provides formal support, Group Chats remain a closed interface feature rather than a developer-accessible capability.\nHere is a standalone concluding subsection tailored for the article, focusing on what the ChatGPT Group Chat rollout means for enterprise decision makers in both pilot regions and globally:\nImplications for enterprise AI and data leaders\nFor enterprise teams already leveraging AI platforms—or preparing to—OpenAI’s group chat feature introduces a new layer of multi-user collaboration that could shift how generative models are deployed across workflows. While the pilot is limited to users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, its design and roadmap offer key signals for AI engineers, orchestration specialists, and data leads globally.\nAI engineers managing large language model (LLM) deployments can now begin to conceptualize real-time, multi-user interfaces not just as support tools, but as collaborative environments for research, content generation, and ideation. This adds another front in model tuning: not just how models respond to individuals, but how they behave in live group settings with context shifts and varied user intentions.\nFor AI orchestration leads, the ability to integrate ChatGPT into collaborative flows without exposing private memory or requiring custom builds may reduce friction in piloting generative AI in cross-functional teams. These group sessions could serve as lightweight alternatives to internal tools for brainstorming, prototyping, or knowledge sharing—useful for teams constrained by infrastructure, budget, or time.\nEnterprise data managers may also find use cases in structured group chat sessions for data annotation, taxonomy validation, or internal training support. The system’s lack of memory persistence adds a level of data isolation that aligns with standard security and compliance practices—though global rollout will be key to validating regional data handling standards.\nAs group chat capabilities evolve, decision makers should monitor how shared usage patterns might inform future model behaviors, auditing needs, and governance structures. In the long term, features like these will influence not just how organizations interact with generative AI, but how they design team-level interfaces around it.",
