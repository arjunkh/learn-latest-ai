We term this process hypothesis hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new framework called AScience, which utilizes networks of autonomous agents to explore vast scientific datasets. This method, termed hypothesis hunting, allows agents to self-organize and peer-review findings, leading to discoveries like new therapeutic targets and the rediscovery of established biomarkers. The experiments, particularly on cancer cohorts, show that this approach could enhance exploratory research significantly. This matters because it opens up new possibilities for scientific discovery without being limited by specific research questions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Immediate impact for researchers, as they can leverage autonomous agents to explore data more efficiently and generate new insights.",
    "On a broader level, this could shift how scientific research is conducted, emphasizing collaborative and exploratory methods over traditional hypothesis-driven approaches."

    "eli12": "Imagine a team of robots searching through a massive library of scientific data, not just looking for specific books but exploring all kinds of ideas. This new method, called AScience, allows these robots to work together, sharing what they find and learning from each other. This matters because it could help scientists discover new treatments and understand diseases better, all while using existing data in innovative ways.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the AScience framework highlights a growing need for tools that facilitate collaborative exploration in research. By employing autonomous agents, organizations could reduce research time and costs while improving the quality of insights generated. This suggests a potential market for platforms that support such advanced data exploration capabilities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, AScience employs a distributed system of LLM-based research agents that interact within a network to explore hypothesis spaces. The framework enables agents to evaluate findings based on shared standards, which enhances the diversity and quality of results. Experiments demonstrated that this social structure can effectively sustain hypothesis hunting, particularly in cancer research, showcasing its potential for large-scale scientific inquiry."
