Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator -- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores how media can influence AI developers to prioritize user safety over profit. By simulating interactions between creators and users, researchers found that media coverage can encourage cooperation, but it only works if the information is reliable and accessible. This matters now as AI technology continues to grow, and effective media could play a crucial role in ensuring safer AI products without needing strict regulations.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Media could help users feel safer, as they rely on trustworthy information to make informed choices about AI products.",
    "This shift suggests that the media could become a key player in the AI landscape, influencing how companies approach safety and accountability."

    "eli12": "Think of media like a referee in a game. If players know someone is watching and will call out bad behavior, they might play fair. This matters to everyday people because it means that the news and reports we see can help keep AI developers honest and focused on safety.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of transparency. If media coverage can drive user trust and safety, investing in clear communication could enhance product reputation and user adoption. It suggests that focusing on ethical practices might not just be good for users, but also beneficial for business.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study employs evolutionary game theory to model interactions between AI creators and users. It shows that reliable media can foster cooperation, but if the costs of safety measures or accessing information are too high, this cooperation fails. Developers might need to consider how their actions are perceived to align with user expectations."
