  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.08026v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Screening patients for clinical trial eligibility remains a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.",

  "speedrun": "A new AI system aims to enhance how patients are matched to clinical trials, addressing the traditionally slow and manual process. This proof-of-concept utilizes large language models to provide structured eligibility assessments and maintains high security standards. By viewing eligibility as a dynamic state, the system could help identify more trial matches and reduce the workload for coordinators. This innovation matters now as it could streamline patient access to potentially life-saving trials.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Patients could experience faster access to clinical trials, improving their treatment options and outcomes.",
    "This development signals a shift towards more efficient, AI-driven processes in healthcare, potentially transforming patient recruitment for clinical studies."

    "eli12": "The new AI system helps match patients to clinical trials more efficiently, which is often a slow and complicated process. Think of it like a smart assistant that not only finds the right job for you but also keeps track of your qualifications and future possibilities. This matters because it could open doors for patients to participate in trials that improve their health outcomes.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this AI system addresses a critical user need: efficient patient-trial matching. By automating parts of the eligibility screening, it could reduce costs and save time for clinical coordinators. The practical implication is that healthcare organizations might adopt this technology to enhance their trial recruitment processes, ultimately benefiting both patients and providers.",
    "engineer": "This system leverages reasoning-enabled large language models to process diverse electronic health record data, moving beyond simple eligibility checks. It generates structured assessments that support human review, treating eligibility as a fluid concept rather than a fixed one. This approach could enhance the precision of patient-trial matching while ensuring that all AI outputs are auditable."
