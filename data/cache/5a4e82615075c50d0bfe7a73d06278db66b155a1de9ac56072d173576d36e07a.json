  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.26887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.",

    "eli12": "Denario is like having a super-smart assistant for scientists. It can help come up with ideas, check research, and even write papers. This could make research faster and more efficient, allowing scientists to focus on big questions instead of paperwork. For everyday people, this means faster discoveries in health, technology, and more.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Denario highlights a growing need for tools that enhance research efficiency. It could reduce costs related to literature review and data analysis while improving the quality of scientific outputs. A practical implication is that integrating such AI tools could help teams innovate more rapidly and effectively.",
    "engineer": "Denario employs a modular architecture to tackle diverse research tasks, leveraging a deep-research backend called Cmbagent. It has been evaluated by domain experts who provided feedback and scores on AI-generated papers across various disciplines. While it shows promise in combining interdisciplinary ideas, attention to its limitations and ethical implications is crucial."
