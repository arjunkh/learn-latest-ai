  "speedrun": "A new study by OpenRouter analyzed billions of interactions to reveal how people truly use AI, challenging the narrative that AI is transforming productivity. The findings suggest that actual usage may not align with popular belief, indicating a gap between expectations and reality. This matters now as businesses and developers refine their AI tools based on how users engage with them, rather than assumptions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This study offers immediate insights for developers, highlighting the need to understand user behavior to create more effective AI solutions.",
    "At a market level, it signals a potential shift in how companies approach AI development, emphasizing user-centric design over broad claims of productivity enhancements."

    "eli12": "The OpenRouter study shows that what we think about AI's role in our work might not match how we actually use it. It’s like expecting a new kitchen gadget to make cooking easier, but finding out people just use it for reheating leftovers. Understanding these real habits can help everyone, from casual users to businesses, make better choices about AI tools.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this study underlines the importance of user research in AI development. It highlights a potential disconnect between user needs and the features offered. By focusing on real usage patterns, product teams could enhance efficiency and satisfaction, ensuring that AI tools meet actual demands.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study's analysis of billions of interactions provides valuable data on user engagement with AI models. It highlights the necessity for engineers to refine algorithms based on this real-world usage rather than assumptions. This could lead to more effective AI applications that align better with user needs."
