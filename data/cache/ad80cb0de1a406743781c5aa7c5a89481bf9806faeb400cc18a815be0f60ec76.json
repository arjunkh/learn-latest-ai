    "eli12": "Imagine if you could measure how much pain someone feels just by taking a picture. That's what researchers are trying to do with AI. By turning pain into numbers, doctors could make better decisions about treatment. This matters because it could lead to quicker relief for people suffering from pain.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a growing user need for precise health metrics. By leveraging AI to measure pain, products could improve patient experiences and outcomes. This could also reduce costs in healthcare by enabling more effective treatments based on accurate data.",
    "engineer": "The initiative involves using AI models to analyze visual data from cameras and sensors to assess pain levels, akin to how blood pressure is measured. This could involve deep learning techniques trained on diverse datasets to ensure accuracy across different populations. However, challenges remain in standardizing measurements and ensuring the technology is widely applicable."
