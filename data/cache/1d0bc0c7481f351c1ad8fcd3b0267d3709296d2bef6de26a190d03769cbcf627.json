  "speedrun": "OpenAI has launched GDPval, a new evaluation tool designed to assess how well AI models perform on economically valuable tasks across 44 different occupations. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and real-world applications, providing a clearer picture of model effectiveness. By focusing on practical tasks, GDPval could help businesses understand the potential return on investment from AI technologies. This matters now as companies increasingly seek to leverage AI for tangible benefits.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses can directly assess AI's impact on their specific sectors, leading to better-informed decisions about technology investments.",
    "This evaluation could signal a shift toward more practical AI applications, emphasizing real-world utility over theoretical capabilities."

    "eli12": "OpenAI has created GDPval, a tool that checks how well AI works in real jobs. Think of it like a report card for AI, showing how it can help in different careers. This is important because it helps people see how AI can make their work easier and more efficient.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, GDPval offers a way to evaluate AI's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Understanding performance in specific occupations can help identify user needs and improve product design. This could lead to better resource allocation and increased efficiency in AI implementation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, GDPval assesses model performance across 44 occupations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for AI applications. This focus on economically valuable tasks may lead to more targeted improvements in model training and deployment. However, engineers should consider the specific contexts in which these models are evaluated to ensure relevance."
