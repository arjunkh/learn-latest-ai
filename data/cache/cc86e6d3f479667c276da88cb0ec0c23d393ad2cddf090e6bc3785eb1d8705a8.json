    "eli12": "Planning before starting an AI project is like mapping out a road trip before hitting the road. It helps everyone know the destination and the best route to get there. This matters for everyday people because it can lead to AI solutions that are more effective and aligned with their needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers, advance planning helps clarify user needs and establish clear metrics for success. This could reduce costs by avoiding missteps and ensuring resources are used efficiently. A practical implication is that teams can pivot more easily if they have predefined benchmarks to assess progress.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, advance planning involves defining metrics and success criteria that can guide model selection and evaluation. Establishing benchmarks early allows for better comparison of different algorithms. This method could lead to more robust AI systems that meet specified performance standards."
