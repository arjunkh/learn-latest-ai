  "raw_body": "Tony Stoyanov is CTO and co-founder of EliseAI\nIn the 2010s, tech companies chased staff-level specialists: Backend engineers, data scientists, system architects. That model worked when technology evolved slowly. Specialists knew their craft, could deliver quickly and built careers on predictable foundations like cloud infrastructure or the latest JS framework\nThen AI went mainstream.\nThe pace of change has exploded. New technologies appear and mature in less than a year. You can’t hire someone who has been building AI agents for five years, as the technology hasn’t existed for that long. The people thriving today aren’t those with the longest résumés; they’re the ones who learn fast, adapt fast and act without waiting for direction. Nowhere is this transformation more evident than in software engineering, which has likely experienced the most dramatic shift of all, evolving faster than almost any other field of work.\nHow AI Is rewriting the rules\nAI has lowered the barrier to doing complex technical work, technical skills and it's also raised expectations for what counts as real expertise. McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated and 12 million workers may need to shift roles entirely. Technical depth still matters, but AI favors people who can figure things out as they go.\nAt my company, I see this every day. Engineers who never touched front-end code are now building UIs, while front-end developers are moving into back-end work. The technology keeps getting easier to use but the problems are harder because they span more disciplines.\nIn that kind of environment, being great at one thing isn’t enough. What matters is the ability to bridge engineering, product and operations to make good decisions quickly, even with imperfect information.\nDespite all the excitement, only 1% of companies consider themselves truly mature in how they use AI. Many still rely on structures built for a slower era — layers of approval, rigid roles and an overreliance on specialists who can’t move outside their lane.\nThe traits of a strong generalist \nA strong generalist has breadth without losing depth. They go deep in one or two domains but stay fluent across many. As David Epstein puts it in Range, “You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning.” True expertise comes from connecting the dots, not just collecting information.\nThe best generalists share these traits:\n\nOwnership: End-to-end accountability for outcomes, not just tasks.\n\nFirst-principles thinking: Question assumptions, focus on the goal, and rebuild when needed.\n\nAdaptability: Learn new domains quickly and move between them smoothly.\n\nAgency: Act without waiting for approval and adjust as new information comes in.\n\nSoft skills: Communicate clearly, align teams and keep customers’ needs in focus.\n\nRange: Solve different kinds of problems and draw lessons across contexts.\n\nI try to make accountability a priority for my teams. Everyone knows what they own, what success looks like and how it connects to the mission. Perfection isn’t the goal, forward movement is.\nEmbracing the shift\nFocusing on adaptable builders changed everything. These are the people with the range and curiosity to use AI tools to learn quickly and execute confidently.\nIf you’re a builder who thrives in ambiguity, this is your time. The AI era rewards curiosity and initiative more than credentials. If you’re hiring, look ahead. The people who’ll move your company forward might not be the ones with the perfect résumé for the job. They’re the ones who can grow into what the company will need as it evolves.\nThe future belongs to generalists and to the companies that trust them.\nRead more from our guest writers.

  "speedrun": "The rise of AI has shifted hiring trends from specialists to generalists in tech. As technology evolves rapidly, companies now seek adaptable individuals who can learn and act quickly. McKinsey predicts that by 2030, 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated, requiring many workers to change roles. This change matters because it reflects the need for flexibility and a broader skill set in an increasingly complex tech landscape.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Tech companies must adapt their hiring practices to find talent that can quickly learn and integrate across disciplines, impacting workforce dynamics.",
    "The shift indicates a broader market trend where adaptability and generalist skills become essential, changing how companies structure teams and roles."

    "eli12": "Tech jobs are changing. Instead of hiring specialists, companies now look for generalists who can learn quickly and adapt. It’s like sports: a versatile player can fill different roles as needed. This matters because it means more opportunities for people who can think broadly and solve problems in various areas.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means prioritizing hiring adaptable individuals who can bridge gaps between engineering, product, and operations. It could lead to more efficient teams and faster decision-making. Emphasizing soft skills alongside technical knowledge may improve overall product development.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the demand is shifting towards engineers who can navigate multiple domains rather than just excelling in one. With AI tools lowering the barriers for complex tasks, engineers are expected to adapt quickly, as seen in roles merging front-end and back-end responsibilities. Companies need to foster environments that encourage this versatility."
