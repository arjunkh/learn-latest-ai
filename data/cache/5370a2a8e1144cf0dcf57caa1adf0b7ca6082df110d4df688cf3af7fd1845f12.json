  "speedrun": "A recent article details the process of adding a new feature to an iOS app using Cursor, a tool known for its coding capabilities. While Cursor excels at writing code, it falls short in design aspects. This insight highlights the need for developers to balance coding efficiency with design quality, which is crucial for user experience. Understanding this balance is essential as more developers turn to AI tools for app development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers using AI tools like Cursor may face design challenges, impacting the usability of their apps.",
    "The reliance on AI for coding may shift the focus in app development, emphasizing the importance of design alongside programming."

    "eli12": "When adding a feature to an app, using tools like Cursor can speed up coding but may lead to design issues. Think of it like using a fast car to get somewhere, but forgetting to check if the road is clear. This matters because good design is key to making apps user-friendly and appealing.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding that tools like Cursor can streamline coding but may neglect design is crucial. This means they might need to allocate resources for design reviews or hire specialists. Balancing these aspects could enhance the overall user experience and retention.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Cursor efficiently generates code but lacks advanced design capabilities. This could lead to a disconnect between functionality and user interface. Engineers might need to manually refine design elements after using such tools, ensuring that the final product meets both technical and aesthetic standards."
