  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.20493v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing, rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured insights that act as a \"map\" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a more effective tool for the modern researcher.",
