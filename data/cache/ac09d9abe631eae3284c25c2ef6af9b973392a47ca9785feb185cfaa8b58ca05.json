Libby Cowgill, an anthropologist in a furry parka, has wheeled me and my cot into a metal-walled room set to 40 °F. A loud fan pummels me from above and siphons the dregs of my body heat through the…",

  "speedrun": "Researchers are studying how our bodies respond to extreme temperatures, with tests conducted in a freezing lab in Fort Worth, Texas. In one experiment, subjects are exposed to 40 °F conditions to measure their physiological reactions. This research could provide insights into climate adaptation and human resilience. Understanding these responses is increasingly important as global temperatures fluctuate.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research could help individuals in extreme climates adapt better, improving health and safety. It addresses the need for effective strategies against heat and cold stress.",
    "On a broader scale, findings could influence public health policies and climate adaptation strategies, reflecting a shift towards understanding human resilience in changing environments."

    "eli12": "Scientists are figuring out how our bodies handle really cold or hot weather. In one test, people were put in a cold room to see how they react. This matters because it can help us learn how to stay safe and healthy in extreme temperatures, especially as the climate changes.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights user needs around health and safety in extreme conditions. Understanding how people adapt could lead to new products or services that enhance comfort and resilience. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing environmental factors in product design.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this study involves monitoring physiological responses to cold exposure, such as changes in body temperature and metabolic rates. Specific metrics could include heart rate variability and heat loss rates. This data could inform the development of better protective clothing or technologies for extreme environments."
