    "eli12": "Gemini is like having a smart assistant that can listen to a video and tell you who is speaking while writing down everything they say. This makes it easier for anyone who needs to turn video content into text, like students or journalists. It matters because it saves time and helps people focus on understanding the content instead of getting bogged down in manual transcription.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Gemini addresses a clear user need for efficient video transcription. By offering speaker identification in one prompt, it reduces the time and cost associated with traditional transcription methods. This could lead to increased user satisfaction and open up new markets for video content analysis tools.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Gemini leverages advanced multimodal AI techniques to process audio and visual data simultaneously, enhancing transcription accuracy. The ability to identify different speakers within a single prompt is a notable feature that sets it apart from existing tools. However, the article does not detail specific models or benchmarks used in this process."
