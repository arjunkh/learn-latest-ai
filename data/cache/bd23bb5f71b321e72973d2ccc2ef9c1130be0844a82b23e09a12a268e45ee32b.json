  "speedrun": "Google has introduced the Interactions API, moving away from the traditional 'everything prompt' approach to AI. This new method allows for deeper reasoning and more structured interactions, enabling AI to manage complex workflows. By focusing on stateful and agentic capabilities, Google aims to enhance how users engage with AI systems. This shift could lead to more efficient and effective AI applications across various sectors.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers and businesses can create more sophisticated AI applications that respond intelligently to user input, improving user experience.",
    "This change signals a broader trend in AI development towards structured interactions, potentially reshaping how AI tools are built and used in the market."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Google's new Interactions API is like teaching an AI to have a conversation instead of just answering questions. It can remember context and handle complex tasks better. This matters to everyday people because it could make your interactions with AI feel more natural and helpful.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the Interactions API offers a way to build AI tools that understand user intent more deeply. This could lead to better user satisfaction and reduced costs in customer support. A practical implication is that products could become more intuitive, adapting to user needs over time.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the Interactions API enables stateful workflows, allowing AI to maintain context across interactions. This contrasts with traditional models that rely on single prompts. Developers might find that this leads to better performance in complex reasoning tasks, but they should consider the increased complexity in implementation."
