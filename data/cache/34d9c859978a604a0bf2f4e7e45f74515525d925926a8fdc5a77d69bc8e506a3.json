  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.05302v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study investigated how assigning personality traits to large language models (LLMs) affects their cooperation in strategic interactions. Using the Big Five personality framework, researchers tested models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. They found that agreeableness significantly boosts cooperation, while other traits play a lesser role. This research is crucial as it highlights how personality steering can influence LLM behavior, impacting their effectiveness in real-world applications.",

    "eli12": "This study looks at how giving personality traits to AI models can change how they work together. Think of it like teaching a robot to be friendly or assertive; it can affect how well they cooperate. Understanding this could make AI tools better at helping us in tasks that require teamwork.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the importance of personality in AI interactions. By designing models with traits like agreeableness, products could enhance user engagement and collaboration. This could lead to more efficient AI-driven solutions in fields like customer service or team management.",
    "engineer": "The study utilized the Big Five framework to assess the personalities of models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 in cooperative scenarios. Results indicated that agreeableness was the most influential trait for cooperation, while earlier models showed vulnerability to exploitation. This suggests that personality steering can bias behavior but isn't a strict control mechanism, emphasizing the need for careful model design."
