  "speedrun": "Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are experimenting with a new form of AI called agentic AI for trade surveillance. Unlike traditional systems that only scan for specific keywords, this AI can analyze patterns in real time to identify suspicious activities needing human attention. This shift could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring trades, which is crucial for compliance in the fast-paced financial sector. The outcome of these tests could set a new standard for AI use in banking.",

    "eli12": "Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are trying out a smarter type of AI called agentic AI for keeping an eye on trades. This AI can think on its own and spot unusual patterns, unlike older systems that just look for certain words. This matters because it could help banks catch problems faster and keep trading safer for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the testing of agentic AI represents a significant opportunity to improve trade surveillance tools. Users need systems that can reduce noise from false alerts and enhance compliance efficiency. This could lead to developing more sophisticated AI solutions that meet regulatory demands while cutting operational costs.",
    "engineer": "The agentic AI being tested by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank is designed to analyze trading patterns in real time, moving beyond static keyword alerts. This approach may leverage advanced machine learning models that can reason through data, potentially improving detection rates of irregular trading activities. However, the success of such systems will depend on their ability to accurately interpret complex market behaviors."
