  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.02228v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.\n  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.",

  "speedrun": "The STRIDE framework offers a method for determining when to use different AI modalities, such as direct LLM calls or fully autonomous agents. It achieved 92% accuracy in selecting the appropriate modality across 30 tasks, reducing unnecessary agent deployments by 45% and cutting resource costs by 37%. This framework is crucial as the shift to agentic AI increases complexity and costs, making it essential to deploy such technology judiciously.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses can now optimize their AI use, minimizing costs and risks while ensuring effective task handling.",
    "The STRIDE framework signals a shift in AI deployment strategy, emphasizing careful selection based on task dynamics rather than blanket adoption."

    "eli12": "STRIDE helps decide when to use different types of AI, like simple chatbots or more complex agents. Think of it like choosing the right tool for a job; you wouldn't use a hammer for a screw. This matters because it helps save money and resources while improving how we use AI in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, STRIDE highlights the importance of understanding user needs when implementing AI. It emphasizes efficiency and cost savings by selecting the right AI modality for specific tasks. This could lead to better resource allocation and improved user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "STRIDE employs structured task decomposition and an Agentic Suitability Score to evaluate task requirements effectively. With a 92% accuracy rate in modality selection, it reduces unnecessary agent deployments by 45% and resource costs by 37%. This approach ensures that agentic AI is utilized only when the task demands it, optimizing performance and resource management."
