  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00816v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Contemporary AI systems achieve extraordinary performance yet remain opaque and non-verifiable, creating a crisis of trust for safety-critical deployment. We introduce MathLedger, a substrate for verifiable machine cognition that integrates formal verification, cryptographic attestation, and learning dynamics into a single epistemic loop. The system implements Reflexive Formal Learning (RFL), a symbolic analogue of gradient descent where updates are driven by verifier outcomes rather than statistical loss.\n  Phase I experiments validate the measurement and governance substrate under controlled conditions. CAL-EXP-3 validates measurement infrastructure (Delta p computation, variance tracking); separate stress tests confirm fail-closed governance triggers correctly under out-of-bounds conditions. No convergence or capability claims are made. The contribution is infrastructural: a working prototype of ledger-attested learning that enables auditability at scale.\n  Keywords: verifiable learning, formal verification, cryptographic attestation, reflexive feedback, fail-closed governance",
