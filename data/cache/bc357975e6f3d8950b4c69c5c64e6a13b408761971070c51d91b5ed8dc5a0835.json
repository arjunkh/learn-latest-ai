  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.04855v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.",

  "speedrun": "A new predictive model, called the epistemic reject-option predictor, aims to improve decision-making in high-stakes situations by allowing models to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high. Unlike traditional methods that only consider aleatoric uncertainty, this model addresses epistemic uncertainty, which arises from limited data. It does this by minimizing expected regret, which measures how much worse the model's predictions are compared to an ideal scenario. This approach could enhance the reliability of AI systems in critical applications, making informed decisions more feasible.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This model could significantly benefit fields like healthcare or finance, where high-stakes decisions are made based on predictions. By abstaining when unsure, it helps prevent costly mistakes.",
    "At a broader level, this approach could shift how predictive models are developed, emphasizing the need for transparency in uncertainty and potentially improving trust in AI systems."

    "eli12": "Imagine a weather forecast that tells you not just if it will rain, but also when it’s uncertain about the prediction. The epistemic reject-option predictor does something similar in high-stakes situations. It helps models know when to hold back on making a prediction, which could protect people from bad decisions. This matters because it could lead to safer and more reliable AI in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this new model highlights the importance of understanding uncertainty in user predictions. By incorporating a mechanism to abstain from low-confidence predictions, teams could enhance user trust and satisfaction. This could also lead to more efficient resource allocation, as efforts can focus on high-confidence areas while avoiding costly mistakes.",
    "engineer": "This model builds on Bayesian learning to redefine how predictive models handle uncertainty, particularly epistemic uncertainty from limited data. By minimizing expected regret, it determines when to abstain from predictions based on a specified rejection cost. This approach could improve the robustness of AI systems, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce, making it a significant advancement in predictive modeling."
