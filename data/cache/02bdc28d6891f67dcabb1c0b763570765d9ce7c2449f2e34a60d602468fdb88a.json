  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.26852v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools. However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.",

  "speedrun": "CATArena introduces a new way to evaluate Large Language Model agents through competitive, iterative tournaments instead of static benchmarks. This platform features four diverse games, allowing agents to learn and improve continuously without fixed score limits. By focusing on peer-learning and self-improvement, CATArena aims to better assess the evolving capabilities of these agents. This matters now as AI systems become increasingly complex and require more dynamic evaluation methods.",

    "eli12": "CATArena is like a sports league for AI agents, where they compete in games to learn and get better over time. Instead of just checking how well they perform in one task, this platform lets them play multiple games and improve continuously. This matters because it helps create smarter AI that can handle more complex tasks in real life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, CATArena offers a way to evaluate AI agents more effectively, focusing on their ability to learn and adapt. This could lead to more efficient development cycles and better products. Understanding how agents improve in dynamic environments could inform user experience design and product features.",
    "engineer": "CATArena utilizes a tournament-style evaluation system that allows LLM agents to engage in diverse games, promoting iterative learning and strategy refinement. By removing upper score limits, it addresses score saturation issues present in traditional benchmarks. This method provides a reliable framework for assessing learning ability and strategic coding, critical for developing advanced AI systems."
