    "eli12": "Imagine using a smart assistant that scans thousands of photos to find hidden problems in your home. That's similar to how AI is now examining CT scans for heart disease signs. This could help doctors catch issues before they become serious, making healthcare more proactive. For everyday people, this means a greater chance of catching heart problems early, which could lead to better health outcomes.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this represents a growing need for innovative health tech solutions. By leveraging AI for early heart disease detection, startups could reduce screening costs and improve efficiency. This could also open new markets in preventive healthcare, positioning companies as leaders in a vital sector.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the startups are utilizing advanced AI algorithms to analyze CT scans, potentially improving accuracy in identifying heart disease indicators. This approach could surpass traditional methods, which often miss early signs. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms will depend on the quality of the data and the models used, highlighting the importance of robust training datasets."
