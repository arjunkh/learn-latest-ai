However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <, <=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers are addressing challenges in working with fuzzy numbers, which represent imprecise data. Traditional methods can lead to complex calculations and problematic results, such as multiplying two triangular fuzzy sets that don’t yield a triangular output. This new study introduces extensional fuzzy numbers and defines operations and relational operators for them. By simplifying these operations, it could expand the practical use of fuzzy numbers in various fields.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could streamline data analysis for industries dealing with uncertainty, like finance or healthcare, where precise data is hard to come by.",
    "The approach reflects a broader trend in AI and data science toward improving tools for managing imprecise information, which is increasingly relevant in today's data-driven world."

    "eli12": "Fuzzy numbers help us deal with uncertain data, but they can complicate calculations. Imagine trying to add two vague amounts of money—it's tricky! This new method makes working with these fuzzy numbers easier, which could help everyday businesses make better decisions based on imperfect information.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights a user need for simpler data handling tools in uncertain environments. By reducing the complexity of fuzzy number operations, products could become more efficient and user-friendly. This could lead to better data-driven insights without overwhelming users with complicated math.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study introduces operations on extensional fuzzy numbers, aiming to overcome issues like high computational complexity and non-fuzzy results from traditional methods. It emphasizes relational operators and provides a C++ implementation on GitHub, which could facilitate easier integration into existing projects."
