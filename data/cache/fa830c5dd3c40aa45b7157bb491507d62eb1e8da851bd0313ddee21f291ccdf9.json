    "eli12": "Think of AI like a kid trying to decorate a cake. It can add sprinkles and icing, but it might also make a mess with too much glitter. If we don’t keep an eye on it, the final product may not look right. This matters because people want clear and trustworthy writing.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this highlights the need for AI tools that not only enhance writing but also ensure accuracy and authenticity. Understanding user concerns about AI-generated content can provide a competitive edge. A practical next step is to gather user feedback on AI writing tools to improve their reliability.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AI's punctuation issues stem from its training data and algorithms, which may not fully grasp context. While it excels at rephrasing, it lacks the nuance required for proper punctuation. Addressing these limitations is essential for creating more reliable AI writing tools."
