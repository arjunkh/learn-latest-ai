  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.16330v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a new paradigm that extends LLMs' capabilities beyond text generation to dynamic interaction with external environments. By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and tool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web navigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in ensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent performance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains, especially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and systematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents. We begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to stakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by situating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review datasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations. Next, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups: methods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions. Moreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and generalizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated into agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and cost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations with architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting opportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled research on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse applications.",

  "speedrun": "A new survey highlights the progress and challenges of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, which go beyond text generation to interact with various environments. It emphasizes the need for generalizability, meaning these agents must perform consistently across different tasks and settings. Currently, there's a lack of clear metrics and methods to measure this generalizability. Understanding and improving this aspect is crucial as these agents are increasingly deployed in areas like web navigation and robotics.",

    "eli12": "This survey discusses how LLM-based agents, like smart assistants, are being designed to do more than just respond to text. They need to understand and act in different environments, similar to how a person adapts to new situations. It's important because as these agents become more versatile, they could improve everyday tasks like online shopping or home automation.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this survey highlights the need to consider how LLM-based agents can be made more adaptable to user needs. Ensuring these agents perform well in diverse scenarios could enhance user satisfaction and reduce costs associated with retraining. A practical implication is that investing in generalizability could lead to more robust products in the market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the survey outlines the importance of generalizability in LLM-based agents, which must perform well across various tasks and environments. It categorizes methods to improve this aspect into three groups, focusing on the backbone LLM, agent components, and their interactions. The need for standardized frameworks and metrics is also emphasized, as these could help in assessing and enhancing agent performance."
