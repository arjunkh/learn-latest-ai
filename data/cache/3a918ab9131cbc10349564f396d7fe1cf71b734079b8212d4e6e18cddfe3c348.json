    "eli12": "Aardvark is like having a smart assistant that helps keep your online life safe. It works by spotting and responding to cyber threats, much like a human would. This is important for everyday people because it could lead to safer online experiences and quicker responses to security issues.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Aardvark addresses a crucial user need for efficient cybersecurity solutions. By automating threat detection, it could lower operational costs and improve efficiency for security teams. This means products can be developed with enhanced security features without overwhelming human resources.",
    "engineer": "Aardvark leverages advanced AI models to analyze and respond to cybersecurity threats, functioning similarly to a human security researcher. Its deployment could lead to faster identification of vulnerabilities and quicker mitigation strategies. However, the effectiveness of Aardvark will depend on continuous updates to its training data to stay ahead of evolving threats."
