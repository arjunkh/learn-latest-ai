    "eli12": "Google's Gemini AI app uses about 0.24 watt-hours per query, which means it consumes a small amount of energy for each request. Think of it like a light bulb that uses a tiny bit of power when turned on. This matters because as more people use AI, understanding its energy use helps us see its environmental impact.",
    "pm": "For product managers, knowing that Gemini uses 0.24 watt-hours per query could guide decisions on scaling AI services. Lower energy consumption can enhance cost efficiency, making AI more accessible. It’s important to factor in these energy costs when planning product features or marketing strategies.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, Gemini's 0.24 watt-hour energy usage per query indicates a focus on optimizing resource efficiency. This figure can be compared to similar AI models to evaluate performance and sustainability. Engineers should consider these metrics when designing future AI systems to balance functionality and energy consumption."
