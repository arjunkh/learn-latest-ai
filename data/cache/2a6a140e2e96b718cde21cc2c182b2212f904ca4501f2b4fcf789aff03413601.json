    "eli12": "Imagine building a model in Excel like assembling a LEGO set, where each piece represents a different part of the machine learning process. This tutorial shows how a 1D CNN for text works step by step, making it easier for anyone to grasp. It matters because understanding AI can help people make better use of technology in their everyday lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this Excel-based CNN tutorial highlights a growing user need for accessible AI tools. By simplifying complex models, it could reduce costs associated with training and onboarding. This approach might inspire new product features that cater to non-technical users, enhancing user engagement.",
    "engineer": "This tutorial outlines a straightforward implementation of a 1D CNN, focusing on text data. It emphasizes the visibility of each filter and weight, which is crucial for understanding model behavior. Such transparency could aid in debugging and refining models, though it may not scale well for larger datasets."
