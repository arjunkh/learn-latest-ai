  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.12251v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper develops an autonomous agentic framework called V-Math that aims to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling self-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative, compliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks. This reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe the system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and teacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called V-Math has been developed to help Vietnamese high school students prepare for their National High School Graduation Mathematics Exams. It combines three AI agents: one for generating exam questions, another for solving problems with detailed explanations, and a personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Preliminary evaluations show that V-Math produces accurate, matrix-aligned exams and enhances the variety of practice materials. This could transform how students and teachers approach math preparation, making it more efficient and effective.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Students can now practice math more effectively and at their own pace, which could lead to better exam outcomes.",
    "This approach reflects a broader trend of using AI to support education, potentially increasing access to quality resources for all students."

    "eli12": "V-Math is like having a personal math coach that helps students study for their big exam. It generates questions, explains answers step-by-step, and adjusts to how well each student is doing. This matters because it can make studying easier and more effective for everyone, especially in a challenging subject like math.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, V-Math addresses a clear user need: effective exam preparation. By automating question generation and providing personalized tutoring, it could reduce costs associated with study materials and improve learning efficiency. This implies that educational tools can be enhanced with AI to better serve students and teachers alike.",
    "engineer": "V-Math integrates three specialized AI agents, including a question generator conditioned on a specification matrix and a solver that provides detailed explanations. Preliminary evaluations indicate that it achieves high solution accuracy and generates diverse, high-quality question banks. This showcases the potential of AI to align educational resources with national standards and improve instructional support."
