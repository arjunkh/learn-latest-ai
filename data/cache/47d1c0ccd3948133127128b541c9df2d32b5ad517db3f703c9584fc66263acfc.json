Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored how assigning personality traits to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 influences their cooperative behavior in strategic scenarios. Using the Big Five personality framework, researchers found that agreeableness significantly boosts cooperation, while other traits have less impact. Notably, while explicit personality information can enhance cooperation, it also leaves earlier models more vulnerable to exploitation. This research highlights the complex dynamics of personality in AI interactions, which is increasingly relevant as LLMs are used more autonomously.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research could directly impact developers and users of LLMs, improving how these models interact in cooperative tasks.",
    "On a broader scale, it suggests a shift in AI design, emphasizing the importance of personality traits in creating more effective and socially aware AI agents."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how giving personality traits to AI models affects their teamwork. Think of it like assigning different roles in a group project; some roles work better together. The findings show that being friendly helps AI cooperate more, which matters because it can lead to better interactions in real-world applications like customer service.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the importance of user experience in AI interactions. Understanding that traits like agreeableness can enhance cooperation may lead to more effective AI designs. This could improve user satisfaction and engagement, especially in applications requiring teamwork or negotiation.",
    "engineer": "The study analyzed the cooperative behavior of LLMs like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 using the Big Five personality framework in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios. Results indicate that agreeableness significantly influences cooperation, while other traits have limited effects. Importantly, while personality steering can enhance cooperation, it raises concerns about vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier models, suggesting a nuanced approach to AI personality design."
