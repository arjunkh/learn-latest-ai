    "eli12": "Cisco's new router is like a super-fast highway for data, allowing it to move quickly between different AI systems. This is important because as AI grows, the need for quick and efficient data transfer becomes crucial for performance. Faster data movement can improve everything from cloud services to online applications that people use daily.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Cisco's router addresses a significant user need for speed and efficiency in data handling. With AI workloads increasing, this technology could reduce costs associated with data transfer and improve service delivery. Companies that leverage this router may gain a competitive edge in deploying AI solutions.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the 8223 routing system is designed to handle 51.2 terabits per second, which sets a new benchmark for fixed routers. This capability is essential for managing the high data demands of distributed AI workloads across multiple locations. However, engineers will need to consider integration challenges with existing infrastructure and the potential need for updates to support such high speeds."
