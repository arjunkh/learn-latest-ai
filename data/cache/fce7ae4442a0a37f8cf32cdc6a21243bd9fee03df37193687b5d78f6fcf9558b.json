  "raw_excerpt": "This article introduces the Gaussian Mixture Model as a natural extension of k-Means, by improving how distance is measured through variances and the Mahalanobis distance. Instead of assigning points to clusters with hard boundaries, GMM uses probabilities learned through the Expectation–Maximization algorithm – the general form of Lloyd’s method.\nUsing simple Excel formulas, we implement EM step ",
  "raw_body": "This article introduces the Gaussian Mixture Model as a natural extension of k-Means, by improving how distance is measured through variances and the Mahalanobis distance. Instead of assigning points to clusters with hard boundaries, GMM uses probabilities learned through the Expectation–Maximization algorithm – the general form of Lloyd’s method.\nUsing simple Excel formulas, we implement EM step by step in 1D and 2D, and we visualise how the Gaussian curves or ellipses move during training. The means shift, the variances adjust, and the shapes gradually settle around the true structure of the data.\nGMM provides a richer, more flexible way to model clusters, and becomes intuitive once the process is made visible in a spreadsheet.\nThe post The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Day 5: GMM in Excel appeared first on Towards Data Science.",

  "speedrun": "The article explores the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which enhances the k-Means clustering method by measuring distances more effectively using variances and the Mahalanobis distance. GMM assigns points to clusters based on probabilities through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, allowing for soft boundaries rather than hard ones. The implementation of GMM in Excel illustrates how means and variances adjust during training. This is significant as it offers a more nuanced approach to clustering, improving data analysis capabilities.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data analysts can now leverage GMM for more accurate clustering, which could enhance decision-making in fields like marketing and finance.",
    "This shift towards probabilistic models indicates a broader trend in data science, moving from rigid methods to more flexible, nuanced approaches."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Think of GMM like a painter using different brushes instead of just one. Each brush creates a softer line, blending colors beautifully. For everyday people, this means that data can be understood in more complex ways, leading to better insights in various fields.",
    "pm": "For product managers, GMM offers a way to understand user segments more deeply, allowing for tailored marketing strategies. By using this model, teams could reduce costs associated with mis-targeting and improve efficiency in reaching the right audience.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, GMM employs the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to iteratively refine cluster assignments based on probability distributions. This method contrasts with k-Means by allowing for soft clustering, which can lead to more accurate representations of data. The article emphasizes the importance of visualizing GMM in Excel to grasp its dynamics better."
