    "eli12": "The “QuitGPT” campaign is about users unhappy with ChatGPT's performance, especially in coding tasks. Alfred Stephen, a developer, found the chatbot’s responses too long and unhelpful. This matters because many people depend on AI for work, and if it doesn't meet their needs, they might leave for better options.",

If users find that a $20 subscription isn’t delivering value, they may switch to competitors. This highlights the necessity of continuous improvement and responsiveness to user feedback.",
