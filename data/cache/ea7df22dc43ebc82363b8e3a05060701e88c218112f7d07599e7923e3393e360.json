  "speedrun": "Measles cases are surging in the US, with over 2,500 confirmed since January 2025, marking a significant outbreak that began a year ago in Texas. Tragically, three people have died from the disease. This rise in cases coincides with declining vaccination rates, raising concerns about public health. The situation underscores the urgency of tracking outbreaks more effectively, such as through wastewater monitoring.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This outbreak directly impacts communities, especially those with low vaccination rates, increasing the risk of severe illness and death.",
    "The surge in measles cases highlights a troubling trend in public health, potentially prompting shifts in vaccination policy and health monitoring strategies."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Measles is making a comeback in the US, with thousands of cases reported this year alone. This is concerning because lower vaccination rates are allowing the virus to spread. Think of it like a garden: if we don’t keep the weeds (or diseases) in check through vaccinations, they can take over. This matters to everyone because it affects community health and safety.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, the rise in measles cases signals a growing user need for health tracking solutions. As vaccination rates fall, there could be an opportunity to develop tools that help monitor disease outbreaks, possibly improving community health outcomes. Focusing on innovative solutions could enhance efficiency in public health responses.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, wastewater tracking could be a valuable tool for monitoring disease outbreaks like measles. By analyzing wastewater, engineers could identify viral loads and trends in specific communities, potentially before cases are reported. This method could complement traditional surveillance, offering a proactive approach to public health."
