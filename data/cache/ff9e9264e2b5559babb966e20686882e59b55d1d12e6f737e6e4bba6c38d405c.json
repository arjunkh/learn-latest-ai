  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.00048v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: GEPOC, short for Generic Population Concept, is a collection of models and methods for analysing population-level research questions. For the valid application of the models for a specific country or region, stable and reproducible data processes are necessary, which provide valid and ready-to-use model parameters. This work contains a complete description of the data-processing methods for computation of model parameters for Austria, based exclusively on freely and publicly accessible data. In addition to the description of the source data used, this includes all algorithms used for aggregation, disaggregation, fusion, cleansing or scaling of the data, as well as a description of the resulting parameter files. The document places particular emphasis on the computation of parameters for the most important GEPOC model, GEPOC ABM, a continuous-time agent-based population model. An extensive validation study using this particular model was made and is presented at the end of this work.",

  "speedrun": "The GEPOC project has released Version 2.0, focusing on population analysis models for Austria. It emphasizes the need for stable data processes to ensure reliable model parameters. This version details methods for processing publicly available data and includes validation studies for the GEPOC ABM model. This matters now because it enhances the reliability of population studies, which can inform policy and resource allocation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers in Austria can now access validated models that improve the accuracy of population studies, aiding in better decision-making.",
    "On a broader scale, this initiative reflects a growing trend towards open-source data in research, promoting transparency and collaboration."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "GEPOC is like a recipe book for understanding populations, providing clear steps to gather and use data effectively. With Version 2.0, it offers tools that anyone can use to analyze population trends in Austria. This is important for everyday people because it helps ensure that policies are based on accurate and reliable information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, GEPOC Version 2.0 represents a valuable resource for understanding user demographics and behaviors. By leveraging open-source data, they can make informed decisions that enhance user engagement and resource allocation. This could lead to more targeted products that meet the needs of specific populations.",
    "engineer": "Technically, GEPOC Version 2.0 outlines methods for data processing, including aggregation and cleansing, crucial for generating accurate model parameters for the GEPOC ABM. The validation study reinforces the model's reliability, which is essential for any computational analysis in population research. Engineers should note the emphasis on reproducibility and the use of publicly accessible data in this framework."
