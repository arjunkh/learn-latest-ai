  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.12254v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.",

  "speedrun": "DISPLIB is a new library aimed at improving train dispatching by providing a common framework for optimization algorithms. It offers a standardized problem definition and file format, allowing researchers to share data and solutions more effectively. This initiative could enhance the efficiency of railways by enabling better re-routing and scheduling of trains after delays. The availability of real-world problem instances online is particularly significant for fostering collaboration and innovation in this field.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Railway operators could see immediate benefits from reduced delays, leading to improved service reliability for passengers.",
    "This initiative signifies a broader shift towards open data and collaboration in optimization research, potentially accelerating advancements in the field."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "DISPLIB is like a shared toolbox for train scheduling problems, making it easier for researchers to test and improve solutions. By providing common definitions and data, it helps everyone work together better. This matters because it could lead to smoother train services for everyday travelers.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, DISPLIB represents a new opportunity to create tools that optimize train operations. By leveraging standardized data, they could develop solutions that reduce delays and improve efficiency. This could ultimately lead to cost savings and enhanced user experiences for railway customers.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, DISPLIB standardizes the problem of train dispatching, allowing for empirical comparisons of different optimization algorithms. It incorporates real-world problem instances and provides a reference solver, which could help researchers benchmark their solutions against established metrics. This structured approach could lead to more robust and effective algorithms in the future."
