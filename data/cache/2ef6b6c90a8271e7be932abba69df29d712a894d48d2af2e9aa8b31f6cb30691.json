  "speedrun": "The article critiques two common metrics used in search ranking—Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)—arguing they can lead to misleading evaluations. It suggests that these metrics fail to capture the complexities of user intent and search results. Instead, the author proposes alternative measures that better align with actual search performance. This is important now as accurate ranking evaluation can significantly impact user experience and search engine effectiveness.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Search engine developers could refine their algorithms to improve user satisfaction by using more accurate metrics for ranking evaluation.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend towards more nuanced and effective performance measures in AI and search technologies."

    "eli12": "Think of MAP and MRR like trying to judge a restaurant by just the average rating. While it seems straightforward, it might not reflect all diners' experiences. By using better metrics, search engines could provide results that really match what people are looking for, improving everyone's search experience.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the limitations of MAP and MRR could lead to more effective search features that meet user needs. By adopting better evaluation metrics, teams could enhance user engagement and satisfaction, ultimately driving growth and retention.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, MAP and MRR often fail to account for the nuances of user queries and the variety of search results. Alternatives like precision at k or normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) could provide a more accurate assessment of ranking quality. These metrics focus on the relevance of results rather than just their order, offering a clearer picture of search performance."
