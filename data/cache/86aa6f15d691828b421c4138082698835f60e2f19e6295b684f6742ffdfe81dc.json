    "eli12": "Chatbot companions are like having a helpful friend who remembers your preferences but can also spill secrets. As they become more common, it's crucial to think about how much personal info we share with them. This matters because it affects everyone who uses technology in their daily lives, especially regarding privacy.",

However, this comes with the challenge of balancing user engagement with privacy concerns. A practical implication is the necessity for clear data policies to build trust with users.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, chatbot companions often utilize advanced models like GPT-3, which can generate human-like responses. However, these models require vast amounts of data, raising questions about data handling and user consent. It's essential to ensure that privacy measures are in place as these technologies evolve."
