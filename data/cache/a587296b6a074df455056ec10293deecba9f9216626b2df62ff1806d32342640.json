  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.04505v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations, emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids rather than autonomous ethical agents.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study evaluated the ethical performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in construction project management. Using the Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), researchers tested two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios. The results showed that while LLMs performed well in legal compliance, they struggled with contextual nuances and accountability. This matters because it highlights the need for human oversight when using AI in sensitive decision-making areas.",

    "Construction professionals could face challenges if they rely solely on AI for ethical decisions, risking project integrity.",
    "This study signals a broader industry shift towards integrating AI in high-stakes environments, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI, specifically Large Language Models, can assist in making tough decisions in construction. Think of LLMs as a helpful guide that knows the rules, but sometimes misses the bigger picture. Itâ€™s crucial for everyday workers to understand that while AI can help, human judgment is still essential for ethical choices.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a user need for reliable decision-support tools in construction. It suggests that while LLMs can enhance efficiency in legal aspects, their limitations in ethical reasoning require careful integration. A practical takeaway is to ensure that human experts are involved in decision-making processes to maintain accountability.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study employed a mixed-methods approach, testing two leading LLMs against twelve ethical scenarios using the EDSAC framework. The findings revealed that while LLMs achieved adequate performance in structured tasks, they faltered in nuanced ethical reasoning and transparency. This emphasizes the need for ongoing development to improve LLMs' contextual understanding and accountability in sensitive applications."
