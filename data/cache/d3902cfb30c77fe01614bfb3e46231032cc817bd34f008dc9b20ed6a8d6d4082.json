    "eli12": "Big Tech is putting money into ways to remove carbon from the air, which is a big deal for fighting climate change. Companies like Microsoft and Google are working together on this. Just like planting trees helps clean the air, these technologies aim to do the same but on a larger scale. This matters because it shows that big companies are taking climate issues seriously.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend highlights a growing user need for sustainable solutions. Investing in carbon removal could lead to new products and services that meet environmental demands. Additionally, it may offer cost efficiencies in the long run as regulations around carbon emissions become stricter. Companies that innovate in this space could gain a competitive edge.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the consortium is exploring advanced carbon removal methods, which may include direct air capture technologies. These methods are still under development, with varying efficiencies in terms of cost and scalability. It's crucial to monitor the effectiveness of these technologies, as their success could redefine standards for carbon management in the tech industry."
