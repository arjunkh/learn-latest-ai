  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.10467v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Bargaining is often regarded as a logical arena rather than an art or a matter of intuition, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to navigate it due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors. Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new framework to enhance how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle negotiations, addressing their struggles with strategic depth and human factors. They developed AgoraBench, a benchmark with nine complex scenarios like deception and monopoly, and metrics based on utility theory. This approach has shown to significantly improve LLM negotiation performance, aligning it more closely with human preferences. This advancement is crucial as it could lead to more effective AI in real-world bargaining situations.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This improvement could directly benefit businesses and individuals who rely on AI for negotiations, making interactions smoother and more productive.",
    "On a broader scale, this signifies a shift towards more human-like AI capabilities, enhancing trust and usability in various applications."

    "eli12": "Imagine teaching a robot to negotiate like a human. Researchers have created a new way for AI to better understand complex negotiations, using benchmarks that mimic real-life scenarios. This matters because it could help everyday people have smoother interactions with AI, making tasks like buying a car or negotiating a salary easier and more effective.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a vital user need for AI that can negotiate effectively. By adopting the new benchmarks and metrics, teams could enhance their product's negotiation features, potentially reducing costs and increasing user satisfaction. This could lead to AI tools that better understand and meet user expectations in bargaining situations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the introduction of AgoraBench allows for more nuanced evaluation of LLMs in negotiation contexts. It incorporates metrics like agent utility and negotiation power, which are grounded in utility theory. The empirical results indicate that traditional LLM strategies often miss human preferences, but the new framework significantly boosts strategic behavior and opponent awareness, paving the way for more sophisticated AI interactions."
