  "speedrun": "Recently, a post on social media claimed that OpenAI's GPT-5 helped solve 10 unsolved mathematical problems, sparking excitement. However, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, criticized the claim as 'embarrassing.' This incident highlights the tendency for social media to amplify unrealistic expectations about AI capabilities, raising questions about the accuracy of such claims and their implications for public understanding of AI.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and developers might feel pressure to overstate AI achievements, impacting funding and project direction.",
    "This incident reflects a broader trend where social media can distort perceptions of AI, leading to unrealistic expectations in both the industry and among the public."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Demis Hassabis called out an overhyped claim about AI solving math problems, showing how social media can spread misinformation. It’s like someone claiming a new video game can beat every player when it actually has limits. This matters because it can confuse people about what AI can really do in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this incident underscores the need for clear communication about AI capabilities. Overstating what AI can achieve could mislead users and affect product adoption. It's essential to balance excitement with realistic expectations to maintain trust and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the claim about GPT-5 solving 10 unsolved problems raises concerns about the rigor of AI results. While large language models can assist in research, they may not always provide reliable or valid solutions. This highlights the importance of validating AI outputs against established mathematical standards."
