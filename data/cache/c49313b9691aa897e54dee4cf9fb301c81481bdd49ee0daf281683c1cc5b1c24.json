  "speedrun": "Sneha Goenka has been recognized as one of MIT Technology Review’s 2025 Innovators Under 35 for her work on ultra-fast sequencing technology. This innovation could significantly reduce the time it takes to diagnose genetic conditions in children, which currently averages seven weeks. With up to 25% of children in intensive care facing undiagnosed genetic issues, faster diagnosis could lead to timely and effective treatments. This advancement is crucial as it addresses a critical gap in pediatric healthcare.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Children in intensive care could receive quicker diagnoses, allowing for timely treatment and better health outcomes.",
    "This technology represents a shift towards more efficient healthcare solutions, potentially influencing how genetic testing is integrated into medical practices."

    "eli12": "Sneha Goenka created a technology that speeds up the process of reading DNA. Imagine needing a recipe quickly, and instead of waiting weeks, you get it in minutes. This matters because faster diagnoses can help sick children get the right treatment sooner, improving their chances of recovery.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Goenka's ultra-fast sequencing technology highlights a growing demand for rapid diagnostics in healthcare. By addressing user needs for quicker results, this innovation could reduce costs associated with prolonged hospital stays and improve patient satisfaction. Understanding this market shift could inform future product development strategies.",
    "engineer": "Goenka's sequencing technology aims to shorten the genome sequencing process from weeks to potentially hours. This could leverage advancements in computational biology and machine learning to enhance accuracy and speed. While the specifics of the model used aren’t detailed, the implications for pediatric diagnostics are significant, potentially transforming how genetic conditions are identified in critical care settings."
