  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.18833v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.",

  "speedrun": "A new position paper introduces Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS), which shift focus from automation to autonomy in managing business processes. It highlights how generative AI and process mining allow agents to sense, reason, and optimize processes. This evolution could redefine how businesses approach process management, moving towards data-driven autonomy. Understanding these changes is crucial for organizations looking to enhance efficiency and adapt to new technologies.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses could significantly improve efficiency by adopting A-BPMS, allowing for better decision-making through data-driven insights.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend towards autonomous systems in various industries, potentially transforming how organizations operate and compete."

    "eli12": "Think of A-BPMS like a smart assistant that not only helps with tasks but also learns and improves how those tasks are done over time. Instead of just following orders, it can analyze data and suggest better ways to work. This matters because it could change how everyday tasks in businesses are managed, making them smoother and more efficient.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, A-BPMS represents a shift towards tools that can autonomously manage processes. This could reduce costs and improve efficiency by leveraging data insights to optimize workflows. Embracing this technology could enhance user experience and streamline operations, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, A-BPMS integrates generative AI with process mining to create systems that can autonomously manage business processes. These systems utilize data to sense process states and identify improvement opportunities. The focus on autonomy and learning could lead to more adaptive and efficient process management solutions, though careful consideration of governance and oversight remains important."
