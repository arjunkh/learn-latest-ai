    "eli12": "The article talks about how buildings are still causing a lot of pollution, even with new green materials. It suggests looking at old building methods to find better ways to be eco-friendly. This is important for everyone because it can help reduce climate change.",
    "pm": "Architects, builders, and policymakers will use these insights to create more sustainable structures. This approach addresses the inefficiencies of current practices, offering a competitive edge in a market increasingly focused on sustainability. However, failure to adapt could lead to regulatory risks and lost opportunities in green building initiatives.",
    "engineer": "The article suggests a technical shift towards integrating historical building techniques with modern materials to enhance sustainability. This may involve using advanced modeling and analytics to optimize designs for energy efficiency. However, challenges include potential resistance to change and the need for retraining in traditional methods."
