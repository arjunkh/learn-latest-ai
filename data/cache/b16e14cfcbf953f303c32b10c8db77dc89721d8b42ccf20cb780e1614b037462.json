  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.22746v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT), which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new approach called Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) to improve visual reasoning in AI. This method combines various reasoning modes into one model that adapts its approach based on context. It uses a two-stage framework called AdaVaR, which enhances the model's ability to learn and select reasoning modes effectively. This development could significantly advance AI's general reasoning capabilities, making it more versatile in understanding visual information.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could enhance AI applications in fields requiring visual reasoning, such as autonomous driving or medical imaging, where context is crucial.",
    "It indicates a shift towards more adaptable AI systems, potentially improving efficiency and effectiveness across various industries, from tech to healthcare."

    "eli12": "The Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) approach helps AI think more flexibly about visual information, much like how people might choose different strategies for solving puzzles based on the clues they see. This adaptability in reasoning could make AI tools smarter and more helpful in everyday tasks, like identifying objects in photos or assisting in navigation.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, MoVT could mean creating AI solutions that are not only more efficient but also tailored to user needs. By leveraging context-aware reasoning, products could respond better to diverse scenarios, potentially reducing costs and enhancing user satisfaction. This adaptability could lead to more innovative applications in various markets.",
    "engineer": "The MoVT method employs a two-stage learning framework, AdaVaR, which first unifies reasoning modes and then refines mode selection through reinforcement learning. This approach has shown consistent performance improvements across different visual reasoning tasks, indicating its potential for building more generalizable AI models. However, the article suggests that further exploration is needed to fully understand the limitations of this adaptive reasoning paradigm."
