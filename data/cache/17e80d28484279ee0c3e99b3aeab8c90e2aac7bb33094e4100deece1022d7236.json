  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.05106v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs) requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores how rule encodings in prompts for large language models (LLMs) affect their attention and compliance. It finds that formats with low syntactic entropy can improve pointer fidelity but come with a trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy. This analysis covers various attention architectures, establishing bounds on pointer fidelity. These insights are crucial for designing safer AI systems that can adapt to new challenges without compromising compliance.",

    "eli12": "This study looks at how to make AI systems safer by using specific rules in their prompts. Think of it like teaching a dog with clear commands; the clearer the command, the better the response. For everyday people, this means that the AI they interact with could become more reliable and trustworthy.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research stresses the importance of clear rule encoding in AI prompts. It suggests that focusing on low syntactic entropy could enhance user compliance while managing costs. A practical takeaway is to consider how rule designs can adapt dynamically as user needs evolve.",
