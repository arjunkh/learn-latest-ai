    "eli12": "At the AI Expo, excitement over new AI models is giving way to real-world challenges. Companies are realizing that just having fancy tools isn't enough; they need to fit these tools into what they already do. Think of it like trying to add a new ingredient to a recipe—you need to ensure it blends well with what you already have. This matters because it affects how everyday people will interact with AI in their jobs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift means a stronger focus on user needs and practical solutions. As companies seek to integrate AI into their workflows, there’s an opportunity to create tools that simplify this process. Efficiency in implementing AI could lead to cost savings and improved user satisfaction. Understanding these dynamics can help in shaping products that meet evolving market demands.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the discussions at the expo indicate a move towards optimizing AI tools for production environments. This involves addressing integration challenges and ensuring compatibility with existing technology stacks. Engineers may need to focus on developing solutions that facilitate smooth transitions from experimental phases to full deployment. This could involve refining models to enhance performance in real-world applications."
