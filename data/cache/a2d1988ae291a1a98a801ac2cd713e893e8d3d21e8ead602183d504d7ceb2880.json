  "speedrun": "North American enterprises are increasingly implementing agentic AI systems that can operate independently. A report from Digitate reveals that while AI adoption is widespread, North America is pushing towards full autonomy, unlike Europe, which focuses more on governance. This shift highlights a significant difference in how regions approach AI deployment. Understanding these trends is crucial as they may influence global AI strategies and investments in the near future.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses in North America could benefit from enhanced efficiency and innovation by leveraging autonomous AI systems, potentially transforming workflows.",
    "This trend may indicate a broader shift in the global AI landscape, suggesting that North America could lead in autonomous AI capabilities while Europe emphasizes regulatory frameworks."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "North American companies are using AI that can think and act on its own, which is like giving a robot the freedom to make decisions without asking for help. This could make businesses run smoother and faster. It matters because if companies can use AI effectively, it could change how we work and interact with technology every day.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of autonomous AI in North America signals a growing user demand for self-sufficient systems that enhance productivity. This trend may lead to cost savings and improved efficiency in operations. Companies should consider how to integrate these capabilities into their products to meet evolving market needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, North American firms are advancing towards fully autonomous agentic AI systems, as highlighted by Digitate's findings. This contrasts with European companies that are focusing on governance frameworks. Engineers should be aware of these regional differences as they could shape development priorities and collaboration opportunities in the AI space."
