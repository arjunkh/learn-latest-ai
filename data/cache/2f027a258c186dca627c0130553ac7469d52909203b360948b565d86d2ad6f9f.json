    "eli12": "Imagine electricity demand like a balloon that keeps inflating. As more devices and technologies, especially AI, need power, the balloon expands. This means more energy is required, which could lead to higher costs for everyone. Understanding these changes helps everyday people prepare for potential increases in their energy bills.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rising electricity demand highlights a critical user need for energy-efficient solutions. As costs may rise, focusing on efficiency could drive product development. Companies that innovate in this space could capture a growing market of cost-conscious consumers.",
    "engineer": "The World Energy Outlook indicates a 30% increase in global electricity demand by 2025, largely influenced by AI technologies. This trend suggests a need for advancements in grid infrastructure and energy management systems to handle increased loads efficiently. Engineers will need to innovate in energy storage and distribution to meet these demands."
