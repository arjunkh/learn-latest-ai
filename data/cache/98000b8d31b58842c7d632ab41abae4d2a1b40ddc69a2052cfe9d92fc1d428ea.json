Think of it like a buffet where businesses can pick what suits them best, whether it's SAP's own services or trusted local ones. This matters because it helps ensure that companies can operate under regulations they trust and feel secure about their data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, SAP's EU AI Cloud represents a significant opportunity to cater to organizations seeking control over their data. By offering flexible options, this initiative could reduce costs associated with compliance and data management. Companies might want to consider how they can leverage these services to meet user demands for local data sovereignty.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, SAP's EU AI Cloud consolidates various sovereignty initiatives into one coherent framework. This approach allows organizations to utilize either SAP's data centers or other European-certified options, potentially improving data security and compliance. It will be important to monitor how this affects performance benchmarks and integration with existing systems."
