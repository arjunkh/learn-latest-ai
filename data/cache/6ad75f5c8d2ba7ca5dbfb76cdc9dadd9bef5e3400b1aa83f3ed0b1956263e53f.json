    "eli12": "Sara Nobrega talks about how data scientists can evolve into AI engineers by learning to build systems that work well in real life. Think of it like moving from being a great cook to running a restaurant; you need to know how to manage everything. This shift matters because it helps ensure that tech solutions are practical and effective for everyday use.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this transition means that hiring candidates with strong software engineering skills is becoming essential. As user needs evolve, so does the demand for systems that can adapt and perform under real-world conditions. This could lead to more efficient products that better meet customer expectations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Nobrega emphasizes the integration of LLMs into DevOps practices, highlighting their potential to streamline workflows. Junior data scientists should focus on software engineering fundamentals, which could enhance their ability to build resilient systems. This approach aligns with industry trends towards more versatile and robust AI applications."
