  "speedrun": "A 2024 report by Stand.Earth reveals that air freight emissions have surged by 25% since 2019. This rise is largely due to the pandemic's impact, which saw a boom in cargo-only fleets as demand for quick deliveries increased. The report emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to mitigate these emissions. Addressing this issue is crucial as the logistics industry seeks to balance rapid delivery with environmental responsibility.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Airlines and freight companies face pressure to adopt greener practices, which could lead to investment in SAF technologies. This shift could reduce emissions significantly.",
    "The rise in air freight emissions signals a broader trend in logistics, pushing industries toward sustainable solutions and influencing regulatory policies worldwide."

    "eli12": "Air freight emissions have jumped 25% since 2019, mainly because more cargo planes were needed during the pandemic. Think of it like a balloon that expands when you blow air into it too quickly. This matters because as people demand faster deliveries, companies need to find ways to make that process cleaner for the environment.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this surge in air freight emissions highlights a critical user need for faster and greener delivery options. Investing in sustainable aviation fuel could not only meet consumer demand but also improve operational efficiency. Companies that adapt to these environmental expectations might gain a competitive edge in the market.",
    "engineer": "The report from Stand.Earth indicates a 25% increase in emissions from air freight since 2019, attributed to the rise of cargo-only fleets during the pandemic. This scenario emphasizes the potential role of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in reducing these emissions. Engineers should consider the integration of SAF in logistics operations to meet both regulatory standards and consumer expectations."
