  "speedrun": "A new approach to intent classification in enterprise AI systems focuses on modular design, which could streamline and enhance the process. This method allows for different components to be updated or replaced independently, improving scalability. The article highlights that modular systems can adapt more easily to changing user needs. As businesses increasingly rely on AI for customer interactions, this innovation is timely and relevant.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies using AI for customer service can benefit from faster updates and improved accuracy in understanding user intent.",
    "This modular approach indicates a shift towards more flexible AI systems, potentially leading to better user experiences and increased efficiency across industries."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Think of a modular intent recognition engine like a Lego set, where each piece can be changed or upgraded without needing to rebuild the whole thing. This flexibility means businesses can keep up with new trends or user preferences more easily. For everyday people, this could lead to smoother interactions with AI systems, making services more responsive and helpful.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this modular design could meet user needs more effectively by allowing quicker adaptations to features or functionalities. It may also reduce costs associated with overhauling entire systems. Practically, this means teams can focus on improving specific areas of their product without significant downtime.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, modular design in intent classification allows for individual components, like natural language processing models, to be optimized separately. This could lead to better performance metrics, as teams can implement the latest advancements without disrupting the entire system. However, maintaining cohesion between modules remains a critical challenge."
