  "raw_body": "Fetch AI, a startup founded and led by former DeepMind founding investor, Humayun Sheikh, on Wednesday announced the release of three interconnected products designed to provide the trust, coordination, and interoperability needed for large-scale AI agent ecosystems. \nThe launch includes ASI:One, a personal-AI orchestration platform; Fetch Business, a verification and discovery portal for brand agents; and Agentverse, an open directory hosting more than two million agents. \nTogether, the system positions Fetch as an infrastructure provider for what it calls the “Agentic Web”—a layer where consumer AIs and brand AIs collaborate to complete tasks instead of merely suggesting them.\nThe company says the tools address a central limitation in current consumer AI: models can provide recommendations but cannot reliably execute multi-step actions that require coordination across businesses. Fetch’s approach centers on enabling agents from different organizations to interoperate securely, using verified identities and shared context to complete end-to-end workflows.\n“We’re creating the same foundation for agents that Google created for websites,” said Humayun Sheikh, Founder and CEO of Fetch AI, and an early investor in DeepMind, in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “Instead of just finding information, your personal AI coordinates with verified brand agents to get things done.”\nFetch’s founding and DeepMind connection \nFetch AI was founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh, an entrepreneur whose early investment in DeepMind helped support the company’s commercial development before its acquisition by Google. “I was one of the first five people at DeepMind and its first investor. My check was the first one in,” Sheikh said, reflecting on the period when advanced machine learning research was still largely inaccessible outside major technology companies.\nHis early experience helped shape Fetch’s direction. “Even in 2013, it was clear to me that agentic systems were going to be the ones that worked. That’s where I focused—on the agentic web,” Sheikh noted. Fetch built on this thesis by developing infrastructure for autonomous software agents, focusing on verifiable identity, secure data exchange, and multi-agent coordination. \nOver the past several years, the company has expanded to a 70-person team across Cambridge and Menlo Park, raised approximately $60 million, and accumulated more than one million users interacting with its model—data that informed the design of the newly launched products.\nSheikh added that his decision to bootstrap the company initially came directly from the proceeds of the DeepMind exit, noting in the interview that while the sale to Google was “a good exit,” he believed the team could have held out for a higher valuation. \nThe early self-funding period allowed Fetch to begin work in 2015—well before transformer architectures went mainstream—on the hypothesis that agentic infrastructure would become foundational to applied AI.\nASI:One is a platform for multi-agent orchestration\nAt the core of the launch is ASI:One, a language model interface designed specifically for coordinating multiple agents rather than addressing isolated queries. Fetch describes it as an “intelligence layer” that handles context sharing, task routing, and preference modeling.\nThe system stores user-level signals such as favored airlines, dietary constraints, budget ranges, loyalty program identifiers, and calendar availability. When a user requests a complex task — such as planning a trip with flights, hotels, and restaurant reservations — ASI:One retrieves those preferences and delegates work to the appropriate verified agents. The agents then return actionable outputs, including inventory and booking options, rather than generic recommendations.\nIn practice, ASI:One functions as a workflow generator across organizational boundaries. By contrast with conventional LLM applications, which often rely on APIs or RAG techniques to surface information, ASI:One is built to coordinate autonomous agents that can complete transactions. Fetch notes that personalization improves over time as the model accumulates structured preference data.\nSheikh emphasized the distinction between orchestrated execution and traditional AI output. “This isn’t searching for options separately and hoping they work together,” he said. “It’s orchestration.” \nHe added that Fetch’s architecture is intentionally modular: “Our architecture is a mix of agentic and expert models. One large model isn’t enough — you need specialists. That’s why we built ASI1, tuned specifically for agentic systems.”\nThe interview also revealed new details about ASI:One’s personalization systems: the platform uses multiple user-owned knowledge graphs to store preferences, travel history, social connections, and contextual constraints. \nThese knowledge graphs are siloed per user and not co-mingled with any Fetch-operated data. Sheikh described this as a “deterministic backbone” that gives the personal AI a stable memory layer beyond the probabilistic output of a single large model.\nASI:One launches in Beta today, with a broader release planned for early 2026. Fetch also offers ASI:One Mobile, released earlier this year, giving users access to the same agent-orchestration capabilities on iOS and Android. The mobile app connects directly to Agentverse and the user’s knowledge graphs, enabling on-the-go task execution and real-time interaction with registered agents.\nFetch Business offers verified identity and brand control\nTo enable reliable coordination between consumers and companies, Fetch is introducing a verification and discovery portal called Fetch Business. \nThe platform allows organizations to verify their identity and claim an official Brand Agent handle — for example, @Hilton or @Nike — regardless of which tools they use to build the underlying agent.\nFetch positions the product as an analogue to ICANN domain registration and SSL certificate systems for websites. Verified status is intended to protect consumers from interacting with counterfeit or untrusted agents, a problem the company describes as a major barrier to widespread agent adoption.\nThe system includes low-code tools for small businesses to create agents in a few steps and connect real-time APIs such as inventory, booking systems, or CRM platforms. \n“With Fetch, you can create an agent in one minute. It gets a handle, like a Twitter username, and you can personalize it completely—even give it your social media permissions to post on your behalf,” Sheikh said. Once a brand claims its namespace, its agent becomes discoverable to consumer AIs and other agents inside Agentverse.\nThe company has pre-reserved thousands of brand namespaces in anticipation of demand. Verification status persists across any platform that integrates with Agentverse, creating a portable identity layer for business agents.\nThe interview highlighted that Fetch Business inherits web-trust primitives directly: domain owners verify their identity by inserting a short code snippet into their existing website backend, allowing the system to pass a cryptographic challenge and grant the agent an authenticity badge similar to a “blue check” for agent identities. Sheikh framed this as “reusing the trust layer the web already spent decades building.”\nCompanies can begin claiming agents now at business.fetch.ai.\nAgentverse is an open directory of more yhan 2 million agents\nThe final component of the release is Agentverse, an open directory and cloud platform that hosts agents and enables cross-ecosystem discoverability. Fetch states that millions of agents have already registered, spanning travel, retail, entertainment, food service, and enterprise categories.\nAgentverse provides metadata, capability descriptions, and routing logic that ASI:One uses to identify appropriate agents for specific tasks. It also supports secure communication and data exchange between agents. The company notes that the directory is platform-agnostic: agents built with any framework can join and interoperate.\nAccording to Sheikh, the lack of a discovery layer is one reason most AI agents see little or no usage. “Ninety percent of AI agents never get used because there’s no discovery layer,” he said. \nHe framed the role of Agentverse in more technical terms: “Right now, if you build an agent, there’s no universal way for others to discover it. That’s what AgentVerse solves—it’s like DNS for agents.” He also described the system as an essential component of the emerging agent economy: “Fetch is building the Google of agents. Just like websites needed search, agents need discovery, trust, and interaction—Fetch provides all of that.”\nThe interview further underscored that Agentverse is cloud-agnostic by design. Sheikh contrasted this with competing agent ecosystems tied to specific cloud providers, arguing that a universal registry is only viable if independent of proprietary cloud environments. He said the open architecture enables an LLM to query any agent “within one minute of deployment,” turning agent publication into a near-instantaneous process similar to registering a domain.\nAgentverse also integrates payment pathways, enabling agents to execute purchases using partners such as Visa, Skyfire, and supported stablecoins. Consumers can configure spending limits or require explicit approval for transactions.\nIndustry context and implications\nFetch’s launch comes at a time when consumer AI platforms are exploring the shift from static chat interfaces toward autonomous agents capable of completing actions. However, most agent systems remain limited by siloed architectures, limited interoperability, and weak verification standards.\nFetch positions its infrastructure as a response to these limitations by providing a cross-platform coordination layer, identity system, and directory service. The company argues that an agent ecosystem requires consistent verification mechanisms to ensure that consumers interact with authentic brand representatives rather than imitations. By establishing namespace control and portable trust indicators, Fetch Business aims to fill a gap similar to early web domain verification.\nAt the same time, ASI:One attempts to centralize user preference data in a way that enables more efficient personalization and multi-agent coordination. This approach differs from generalist LLM applications, which often lack persistent preference architectures or direct access to brand-controlled agents.\nThe interview also made clear that micropayments and digital transaction infrastructure are central to Fetch’s long-term vision. Sheikh referenced integrations with protocols such as Coinbase’s 402 and AP2, positioning these capabilities as essential for autonomous agents to complete end-to-end tasks that include financial execution.\nFetch’s combined release of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse introduces an interconnected stack designed to support large-scale deployment and usage of AI agents. The company frames the system as foundational infrastructure for an agentic ecosystem, where consumer AIs can coordinate with verified brand agents to complete tasks reliably and securely. The additions to its identity, discovery, and orchestration layers reflect Fetch’s long-standing thesis — rooted partly in lessons from DeepMind’s early development — that intelligence becomes meaningful only when paired with the capacity to act.",
