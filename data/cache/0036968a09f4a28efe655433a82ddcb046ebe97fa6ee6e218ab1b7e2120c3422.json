    "eli12": "A group of hackers, possibly from North Korea, stole a huge amount of Ethereum from Bybit, a crypto trading platform. They found a way in by targeting the exchange's security system. This is like breaking into a bank vault through a weak door. It matters because it shows how vulnerable digital money can be, affecting everyone who uses cryptocurrency.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in the crypto space, this incident highlights the critical need for robust security features. Users expect their assets to be safe, and any breach could lead to loss of trust and business. Investing in better security measures could be essential to retain customers and comply with potential new regulations.",
    "engineer": "This attack on Bybit involved a sophisticated supply chain approach, targeting the exchange’s multi-signature security process. The loss of over $1.5 billion in Ethereum indicates a significant vulnerability in the system's architecture. Security engineers might need to reassess their protocols and consider implementing more advanced encryption and monitoring solutions to mitigate such risks."
