    "eli12": "SS&C Blue Prism is helping companies move from basic automation to smarter systems that can learn and adapt. Think of it like upgrading from a simple calculator to a smartphone that can do much more. This matters because it means everyday tasks can be done more efficiently, freeing up time for people to focus on more complex work.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this transition from RPA to agentic AI highlights a growing user need for adaptable solutions. It could reduce operational costs and improve efficiency by automating more complex tasks. A practical implication is that teams may need to rethink their automation strategies to integrate these smarter systems effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, moving to agentic AI offers a shift from rule-based RPA to models that learn from data and adapt over time. This could involve implementing machine learning algorithms that improve task execution and decision-making. However, organizations should consider the complexities of integrating these advanced systems into their existing workflows."
