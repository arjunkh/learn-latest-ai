    "eli12": "Prompt injections are like trick questions that confuse AI systems into giving wrong answers. As AI becomes part of our daily lives, understanding these tricks helps us use AI safely and effectively. This matters because it ensures we can trust AI to provide accurate and helpful information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, prompt injections highlight a critical user safety concern that could affect product reliability. Addressing these vulnerabilities could improve user trust and retention. Developing safeguards might also lead to increased costs, but it is essential for long-term product viability.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, prompt injections exploit the way AI models interpret input, potentially leading to unintended outputs. OpenAI's ongoing research focuses on enhancing model training and implementing safeguards to mitigate these risks. This work is vital as the effectiveness of AI systems relies heavily on their ability to resist such manipulations."
