  "speedrun": "Researchers have found a linear-time solution to the Subset Sum Problem, a classic NP-complete issue, but only when input values are sufficiently close together. This breakthrough could significantly speed up computations in specific scenarios, as traditional methods often require exponential time. The implications of this discovery are notable, especially for fields that rely on combinatorial optimization, such as cryptography and resource allocation. It matters now because faster algorithms could enhance efficiency in various applications.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to find a specific combination of weights in a gym bag. If the weights are all similar, it's easier to find the right mix quickly. This new solution helps tackle complex problems faster, which could make everyday tasks like budgeting or planning more efficient for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this discovery highlights a user need for speed in data processing. By leveraging this linear-time solution, products could handle larger datasets more efficiently, reducing costs and improving user experiences. A practical implication could be faster analytics tools for businesses.",
    "engineer": "The new approach to the Subset Sum Problem offers a linear-time solution under specific conditions, particularly when input values are densely packed. This contrasts sharply with traditional exponential-time algorithms, making it a valuable method for certain applications. However, the solution's effectiveness depends on the input's characteristics, which is a crucial consideration for engineers."
