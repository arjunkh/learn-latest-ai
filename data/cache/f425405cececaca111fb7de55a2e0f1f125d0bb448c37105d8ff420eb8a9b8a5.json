  "speedrun": "Everyday decisions, like setting insurance premiums or making courtroom judgments, are often influenced by 'noise'—random variations that lead to inconsistent outcomes. Studies show that this noise can cause significant disparities, with decision-making errors costing billions annually. AI has the potential to reduce this noise by providing data-driven insights, leading to more consistent and fair decisions. Addressing this issue is crucial as it impacts various sectors, from finance to legal systems.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Individuals facing insurance claims could benefit from more consistent decisions, reducing their financial uncertainty.",
    "On a broader scale, industries may see improved efficiency and fairness, which could reshape standards across sectors like finance and law."

    "eli12": "Think of noise in decision-making like background chatter that makes it hard to hear a clear conversation. AI can help filter out this noise, allowing for clearer, more consistent decisions. This matters to everyday people because it could mean fairer treatment in areas like insurance and legal cases.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding noise in decision-making highlights a user need for consistency in outcomes. AI tools that reduce this noise could enhance user trust and satisfaction, ultimately leading to better retention. This presents an opportunity to innovate solutions that simplify complex decision processes.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, addressing noise in decision-making involves leveraging AI models that analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and reduce variability. For instance, applying machine learning algorithms can help standardize outcomes in insurance pricing. However, ensuring the quality of input data is essential to avoid amplifying existing biases."
