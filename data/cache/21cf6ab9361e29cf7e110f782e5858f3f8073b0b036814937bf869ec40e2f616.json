  "speedrun": "The Masumi Network highlights how integrating AI with blockchain could enhance trust in the growing agent economy. By 2026, many organizations are expected to deploy AI agents across various roles. However, a prediction from IDC warns that by 2030, up to 20% of the Global 1000 companies may face lawsuits due to these technologies. This underscores the urgent need for frameworks that ensure accountability in AI applications.",

    "eli12": "The Masumi Network shows how combining AI and blockchain can make using AI agents safer and more trustworthy. Think of it like having a secure lock on a door; it helps ensure that only the right people can access important information. This matters because as AI becomes more common in workplaces, people need to feel confident that these systems are reliable and fair.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this fusion of AI and blockchain presents a chance to build solutions that prioritize trust. As users demand accountability, creating transparent AI systems could enhance user satisfaction and reduce legal risks. This approach could also lead to more efficient operations by establishing clear protocols for AI behavior.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the Masumi Network suggests leveraging blockchain to audit AI agent actions, potentially mitigating legal risks. With IDC predicting that 20% of Global 1000 organizations might face lawsuits by 2030, engineers could focus on developing robust frameworks that ensure transparency and accountability in AI operations. This integration could involve using specific blockchain models to securely log AI decisions."
