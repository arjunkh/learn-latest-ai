    "eli12": "Hyperparameter tuning is like adjusting the settings on a camera to get the best picture. In decision trees, changing parameters can help avoid mistakes and improve results. This is important for anyone using AI, as better models lead to more reliable outcomes in everyday applications.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding hyperparameter tuning is key to meeting user needs for accuracy in AI products. By optimizing decision trees, you can enhance efficiency and reduce costs associated with poor predictions. This means more reliable features and better user experiences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, tuning hyperparameters like maximum depth and minimum samples per leaf can drastically change a decision tree's structure and performance. For instance, limiting maximum depth can prevent overfitting, leading to more generalizable models. Engineers should consider these adjustments for achieving optimal results in their machine learning projects."
