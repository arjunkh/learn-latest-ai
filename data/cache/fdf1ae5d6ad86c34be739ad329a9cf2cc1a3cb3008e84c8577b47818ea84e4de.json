  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.01295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled \"social laboratory\" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\\mu} > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have released the code and results at https://github.com/znreza/multi-agent-LLM-eval-for-debate.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents has been proposed, moving beyond traditional benchmarks. This framework uses multi-agent debates to analyze how these models communicate and collaborate. Findings show that agents can reach a high level of consensus (over 88% semantic agreement) even without explicit instructions. This approach is crucial as it helps understand the social behaviors of AI agents, which is increasingly important in their development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could enhance evaluations for developers, ensuring LLMs are more aligned with human social dynamics.",
    "It suggests a shift in AI evaluation methods, moving towards understanding interactions rather than just task performance."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Imagine teaching kids how to work together on a project. This new evaluation method for AI looks at how well they debate and agree on ideas, rather than just answering questions. It matters because as AI becomes more like us, understanding how they interact could help us use them better in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this framework highlights the importance of evaluating AI interactions, not just outputs. Understanding how LLMs debate and reach consensus could improve user experiences and trust. It suggests that building more socially aware AI might lead to more effective applications.",
    "engineer": "This study introduces a psychometric framework that quantifies LLM behaviors during multi-agent debates. With an average semantic agreement of over 0.88, it demonstrates that LLMs can effectively reach consensus. The findings emphasize the role of assigned personas in shaping cognitive profiles, which could inform future model designs."
