Inspired by early video artists who manipulated analog video signals to create new visual aesthetics, this study proposes a method for extracting and visualizing cross-attention maps in generative video models. Built on the open-source Wan model, our tool provides an interpretable window into the temporal and spatial behavior of attention in text-to-video generation. Through exploratory probes and an artistic case study, we examine the potential of attention maps as both analytical tools and raw artistic material. This work contributes to the growing field of Explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts), inviting artists to reclaim the inner workings of AI as a creative medium.",

  "speedrun": "A new study explores how attention mechanisms in video diffusion transformers can be visualized and understood. It introduces a method for extracting cross-attention maps, enhancing interpretability in text-to-video generation. Utilizing the open-source Wan model, this approach merges artistic expression with technical analysis. This matters now as it empowers artists to engage with AI's processes, transforming them into creative tools rather than just outputs.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Artists can now better understand AI-generated content, allowing for more informed creative choices and innovative expressions.",
    "This research signals a shift in the art world, where AI is becoming a collaborative partner rather than a mere tool, fostering deeper artistic exploration."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI pays attention to different parts of video when creating content. Imagine a painter who focuses on certain colors to create a mood. By visualizing these attention maps, artists can see how AI interprets their ideas and use this knowledge to enhance their own work. This connection between AI and art could lead to exciting new creative possibilities for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in the creative tech space, this research highlights a user need for transparency in AI tools. By providing insights into how AI generates video, companies could enhance user engagement and satisfaction. A practical implication is developing features that allow users to manipulate these attention maps, making the AI more interactive and user-friendly.",
    "engineer": "This paper delves into the mechanics of video diffusion transformers, specifically using the Wan model to extract attention maps. By analyzing temporal and spatial behavior, it offers insights into the generative processes of AI. While the study opens new avenues for artistic exploration, engineers should consider the limitations of interpretability in complex models, ensuring clarity in communication with users."
