This shift marks a significant change in how public sector organizations use automation, moving away from simply adding AI to old systems. Instead, HMRC is building a new foundation designed for machine learning and automation. This modernization is crucial as it could enhance efficiency and responsiveness in tax collection and management.",

    "eli12": "HMRC is updating how it handles taxes by partnering with SAP to use AI. Instead of just adding AI tools to old systems, they are building new ones from the ground up. Think of it like replacing an old car with a new model that runs on smart technology. This matters because it could make tax processes smoother and faster for everyone involved.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, HMRC's partnership with SAP highlights a growing need for modern, efficient systems in public services. By investing in a new architecture for AI, HMRC could improve user experience and reduce operational costs. This shift suggests that there may be opportunities for tech companies to innovate in public sector automation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, HMRC's decision to collaborate with SAP indicates a move towards a more robust infrastructure capable of supporting machine learning. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that simply layer AI on existing systems. Such a foundational change could enhance data processing capabilities and improve overall system performance, paving the way for advanced automation."
