    "eli12": "Imagine searching for a book in a big library. Global search gives you all the books, while local search helps you find the one on the right shelf. Combining both with DRIFT Search means you get the best of both worlds, making it easier for people to find what they need. This matters because better search tools can save time and frustration in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, integrating DRIFT Search could enhance user satisfaction by providing more accurate results. This could lead to reduced search times and improved efficiency in finding information. A practical implication is that teams might need to invest in training to fully utilize these advanced search capabilities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, DRIFT Search utilizes Neo4j's graph database capabilities alongside LlamaIndex's indexing features. This combination allows for more nuanced query handling, potentially improving response times and accuracy. However, engineers should consider the complexity of integration and the need for ongoing maintenance to ensure optimal performance."
