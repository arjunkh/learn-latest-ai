    "eli12": "The article explains how the Inception Score helps evaluate synthetic data by comparing it to real data. Think of it like checking if a painting looks like the scene it represents. This matters because better synthetic data can lead to more effective AI tools that impact daily life, from personalized recommendations to healthcare advancements.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the Inception Score can enhance user experience by ensuring that AI models are trained on high-quality data. This can reduce costs associated with poor model performance and improve efficiency in product development. A practical implication is that better evaluation methods could streamline the data selection process for training AI systems.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article highlights how the proximity of the Inception Score can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the fidelity of synthetic data. This approach allows engineers to quantify the similarity between synthetic and real datasets, which is crucial for training robust models. However, the article suggests that further research is needed to refine these evaluation metrics."
