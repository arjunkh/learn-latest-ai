    "eli12": "Bosch is putting €2.9 billion into AI to make factories smarter. Imagine trying to find a book in a library without a catalog; that's what manufacturers face with all their data. By using AI, Bosch hopes to turn confusing data into clear actions, helping factories run better. This matters because it could lead to more reliable products and potentially lower prices for consumers.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Bosch's investment signals a growing need for AI solutions in manufacturing. As companies strive for efficiency, understanding how to leverage data effectively becomes crucial. This could lead to new opportunities for products that help businesses make faster, data-driven decisions, ultimately improving their bottom line.",
    "engineer": "Bosch's €2.9 billion investment focuses on integrating AI with existing manufacturing systems to enhance data processing capabilities. Current systems use cameras and sensors but struggle to translate this data into actionable insights. By improving the decision-making process, Bosch aims to reduce equipment failures and streamline operations, which could set new benchmarks for efficiency in manufacturing."
