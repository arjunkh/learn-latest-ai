  "speedrun": "The article discusses how healthcare's use of knowledge graphs can inform other industries. Knowledge graphs help create shared meaning and standards, which are crucial for effective communication and decision-making. For instance, they enable diverse data sources to be integrated and understood collectively. This matters now as industries seek to improve collaboration and efficiency in an increasingly data-driven world.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Healthcare providers benefit immediately from enhanced data sharing, allowing for better patient outcomes and streamlined operations.",
    "Other industries could see a shift towards more collaborative data practices, fostering innovation and improving overall efficiency."

    "eli12": "Healthcare uses knowledge graphs to connect different pieces of information, making it easier for doctors to understand patient data. Think of it like a map that shows how various locations relate to each other. This approach could help other fields better organize and share their information, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.",
    "pm": "For product managers, adopting knowledge graphs could enhance user experience by providing clearer insights from complex data. This could lead to more informed decision-making and reduced costs through better resource allocation. A practical implication is that products could become more intuitive, meeting user needs more effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, knowledge graphs utilize ontologies to define relationships between data points, enabling better data integration and analytics. They often rely on models like RDF (Resource Description Framework) for structuring data. However, implementation may require significant initial effort to standardize data inputs across systems."
