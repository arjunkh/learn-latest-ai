    "eli12": "The article explains how to filter data in Pandas using simpler methods, like .query() and .isin(). Think of it as cleaning up your messy room: these techniques help you find things faster and keep everything organized. For everyday people, this means data insights can be reached more quickly and clearly.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, these filtering techniques can save time and resources when analyzing user data. By implementing more efficient data selection, teams can focus on insights rather than getting bogged down in complex code. This leads to quicker decision-making and improved product iterations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, using .query() and .isin() can significantly improve performance in data selection tasks. These methods leverage vectorized operations, which can be faster than traditional Boolean indexing. However, ensuring that the DataFrame is appropriately structured for these techniques is crucial to maximize their benefits."
