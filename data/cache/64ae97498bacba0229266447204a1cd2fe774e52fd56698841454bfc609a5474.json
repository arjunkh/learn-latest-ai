    "eli12": "The new gpt-oss-safeguard models help AI systems understand and label content according to specific rules. Think of them like a librarian who knows exactly where to place each book based on its themes. This matters because it could lead to safer online spaces for everyone, reducing harmful content exposure.",
    "pm": "For product managers, these models represent a way to enhance user trust and safety in applications. By integrating gpt-oss-safeguard, products could streamline content moderation processes, potentially lowering costs associated with manual reviews. This could also improve user experience by ensuring that content aligns with community guidelines.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b are post-trained versions of the gpt-oss models, specifically aimed at policy-driven content labeling. Their performance was evaluated against baseline metrics from the original models, which helps in understanding their effectiveness in safety evaluations. This focus on reasoning from policies is crucial for developing more responsible AI applications."
