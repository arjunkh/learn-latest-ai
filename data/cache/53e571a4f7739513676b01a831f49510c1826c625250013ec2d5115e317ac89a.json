  "speedrun": "Greg Holmes from Apptio emphasizes that scaling intelligent automation needs careful financial planning. He points out that the common approach of expecting automatic success from pilot programs often leads to budget shortfalls. Many executives discover that what works in a small pilot doesn’t translate to broader use, which can hinder long-term success. This insight is crucial now as businesses increasingly rely on automation to improve efficiency.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Executives in tech and automation will need to adopt stricter budgeting practices to avoid overspending. This could help ensure that automation efforts are sustainable.",
    "This highlights a shift in the market towards a more financially disciplined approach to technology implementation, indicating that success requires more than just innovation."

    "eli12": "Scaling intelligent automation isn't just about having great technology. It's like planting a garden; without proper care and resources, the plants may not thrive. For everyday people, this means that companies may take longer to adopt new technologies, but they could be more effective in the long run.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means understanding that successful automation requires a solid financial foundation. It’s not just about launching a product; it’s about ensuring ongoing support and resources. This could lead to better budget allocation and more sustainable growth in automation projects.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, scaling automation requires not just effective algorithms but also a robust financial strategy. Holmes suggests that many pilot programs fail to scale due to a lack of budget planning, which can lead to wasted resources. Engineers should consider the cost implications of their projects to ensure they align with financial goals."
