  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.22210v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.",

  "speedrun": "A new AI framework aims to improve post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh by addressing biases that disadvantage vulnerable areas. Using data from the 2022 floods, which impacted 7.2 million people, the model reduces bias against marginalized regions by over 41%. This is crucial now as it ensures aid is allocated based on real needs, not historical inequities, potentially transforming disaster recovery efforts.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could directly benefit communities affected by floods, ensuring they receive timely and fair aid based on their actual vulnerability.",
    "It signals a shift in disaster management strategies, emphasizing fairness which could influence future humanitarian efforts globally."

    "eli12": "Imagine a system that helps decide who gets help after a flood, focusing on those truly in need rather than past biases. This new AI framework does just that, using data to prioritize aid fairly. It matters because it could change how communities recover from disasters, making sure everyone gets a fair chance to rebuild.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this framework highlights a growing need for solutions that prioritize fairness in aid distribution. By addressing biases, it could improve efficiency in resource allocation, ensuring that aid reaches those who need it most. This approach could inspire new products aimed at equitable disaster recovery.",
    "engineer": "The proposed AI framework employs adversarial debiasing techniques to enhance fairness in aid allocation. It achieves a 41.6% reduction in statistical parity difference and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784). This demonstrates the potential of applying fairness-aware models from healthcare to humanitarian contexts, though it’s essential to monitor implementation challenges in real-world scenarios."
