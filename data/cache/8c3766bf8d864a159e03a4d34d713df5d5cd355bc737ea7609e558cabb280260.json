    "eli12": "Nandan Nilekani is like a builder laying the foundation for a massive digital city. He started with Aadhaar, a system that gives everyone in India a unique identity. This helps people access services more easily, like getting healthcare or opening bank accounts. It matters because as more people use digital tools, their lives could improve significantly.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Nilekani's work highlights the importance of reliable digital identity systems in enhancing user experience. A well-implemented identity framework can reduce costs and improve efficiency in service delivery. This suggests that investing in similar technologies could meet user needs more effectively.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Nilekani's Aadhaar system utilizes biometric data to create a unique identity for over 1.3 billion individuals, showcasing the scale of data management required. The system's architecture must ensure security and privacy while maintaining accessibility, which presents ongoing engineering challenges. These aspects are crucial for developing scalable digital identity solutions."
