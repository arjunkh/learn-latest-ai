  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.09775v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents boldsea, Boldachev's semantic-event approach -- an architecture for modeling complex dynamic systems using executable ontologies -- semantic models that act as dynamic structures, directly controlling process execution. We demonstrate that integrating event semantics with a dataflow architecture addresses the limitations of traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems and object-oriented semantic technologies. The paper presents the formal BSL (boldsea Semantic Language), including its BNF grammar, and outlines the boldsea-engine's architecture, which directly interprets semantic models as executable algorithms without compilation. It enables the modification of event models at runtime, ensures temporal transparency, and seamlessly merges data and business logic within a unified semantic framework.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper introduces boldsea, an innovative architecture for modeling complex systems using executable ontologies. This approach integrates event semantics with dataflow architecture, overcoming limitations of traditional Business Process Management systems. It features the boldsea Semantic Language (BSL), which allows real-time modifications of event models and interprets semantic models as executable algorithms. This development could significantly enhance efficiency in dynamic system management.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This innovation could streamline operations for businesses relying on complex dynamic systems, improving responsiveness and adaptability.",
    "At a broader level, it signifies a shift towards more integrated and flexible semantic technologies in business process management."

    "eli12": "Boldsea is like a smart traffic system that adjusts routes in real-time based on current conditions. It uses executable ontologies to manage complex processes efficiently. This matters because it could help businesses respond faster to changes, improving their overall effectiveness.",
    "pm": "For product managers, boldsea presents an opportunity to create more agile systems that adapt to user needs without costly downtime. The ability to modify event models in real-time could lead to improved user experiences and lower operational costs, making products more competitive.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, boldsea uses a dataflow architecture to execute semantic models directly, eliminating the need for compilation. The boldsea engine interprets these models as algorithms, allowing for runtime modifications and ensuring temporal transparency, which could enhance system performance significantly."
