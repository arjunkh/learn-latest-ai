  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.21360v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.\n  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.\n  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed a new automated framework for analyzing House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawings using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Their experiments showed a semantic similarity score of 0.75 between MLLM interpretations and human expert assessments, rising to 0.85 for expert-level data. This advancement addresses longstanding issues in the HTP test, such as inconsistent scoring and subjective evaluations, marking a significant step toward standardized psychological assessments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Clinicians could benefit from more reliable assessments, leading to better patient outcomes through standardized scoring. This could streamline the diagnostic process.",
    "This development signals a shift towards integrating AI in mental health, potentially transforming how psychological assessments are conducted in clinical settings."

    "eli12": "A new system uses AI to analyze drawings made in the House-Tree-Person test, which helps psychologists understand people's emotions. It scores these drawings similarly to human experts, making evaluations more consistent. This could help people receive better mental health support by providing clearer insights into their feelings.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework could enhance mental health tools by offering standardized assessments. It addresses user needs for reliable evaluations while potentially reducing costs associated with subjective interpretations. The practical implication is that digital mental health services could become more efficient and trustworthy.",
    "engineer": "The study utilized multimodal large language models to achieve a semantic similarity score of around 0.75, improving to 0.85 with expert datasets. This suggests that the model can effectively interpret psychological drawings at a level comparable to trained human evaluators. The multi-agent system's design allows for distinct roles in feature recognition and psychological inference, enhancing the robustness of the analysis."
