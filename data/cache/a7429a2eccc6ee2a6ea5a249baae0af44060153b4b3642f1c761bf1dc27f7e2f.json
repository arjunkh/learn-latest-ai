  "speedrun": "The article discusses the challenges of measuring returns on research and development (R&D) spending, especially amid significant cuts to US federal funding for science. Notably, the proposed reduction for the National Institutes of Health in 2026 could impact innovation and public health. Understanding R&D returns is crucial for justifying investments, particularly when funding is tight. This issue is pressing as it affects the future of scientific advancement and the economy.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and institutions could face funding shortages, limiting their ability to pursue innovative projects. This could slow down progress in critical fields like medicine.",
    "The broader market may see a shift in investment strategies as companies and institutions reassess the value of R&D, potentially leading to a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries."

    "eli12": "Measuring how well R&D spending pays off is tricky, especially now that funding is being cut. Imagine trying to figure out if planting seeds in a garden is worth it when fewer resources are available. This matters because it affects not just scientists but everyone who benefits from new discoveries and advancements in technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding R&D returns is crucial, particularly when funding is limited. They need to align projects with clear outcomes to justify investments. This could mean focusing on projects that show quick returns or societal impact, ensuring that resources are used effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, measuring R&D effectiveness often involves complex metrics like ROI and innovation rates. With potential NIH budget cuts, the pressure increases to demonstrate tangible results from R&D investments. Engineers may need to adopt more rigorous evaluation frameworks to showcase the value of their work."
