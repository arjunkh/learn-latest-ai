    "eli12": "In New Delhi, a project is underway to replace dangerous manual sewer cleaning with robots. Imagine using a vacuum instead of a broom to clean your house; it’s safer and more efficient. This change matters because it can protect workers and improve public health.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this initiative highlights a growing demand for innovative sanitation solutions. By focusing on user safety and efficiency, businesses could tap into a market that values modern technology in public services. This trend may create opportunities for developing new products that address similar challenges in other regions.",
    "engineer": "The Delhi government is working on implementing sewer robots to automate waste removal, which could significantly reduce the risks faced by manual scavengers. Current projects involve nearly 200 contractors, indicating a substantial investment in mechanization. However, the transition from manual to mechanical methods may face challenges related to technology adoption and maintenance."
