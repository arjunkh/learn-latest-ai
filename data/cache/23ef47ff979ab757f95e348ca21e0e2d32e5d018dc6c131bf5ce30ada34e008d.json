    "eli12": "Imagine trying to fill a bathtub with water, but the hose is too narrow; it takes forever to fill up. Similarly, data transfer bottlenecks slow down AI training. By using tools like NVIDIA Nsight™ Systems, engineers can identify these slow points and make adjustments. This matters because quicker training means more advanced AI solutions for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding data transfer bottlenecks is vital for improving AI product efficiency. By leveraging tools like NVIDIA Nsight™ Systems, teams can reduce training time and costs. This efficiency could lead to faster product iterations and a competitive edge in the market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, addressing data transfer bottlenecks is essential for optimizing distributed training workloads. NVIDIA Nsight™ Systems allows engineers to pinpoint slow data paths, which can significantly impact training performance. By resolving these issues, teams could achieve better resource utilization and enhance model training speeds, ultimately improving AI outcomes."
