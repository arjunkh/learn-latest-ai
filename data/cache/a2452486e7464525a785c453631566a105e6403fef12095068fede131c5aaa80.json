  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.09570v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.",

  "speedrun": "A new study highlights the winning method from the CEC-12 competition, focusing on the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP). This problem is crucial as logistics increasingly adopt electric and hybrid vehicles. The winning approach used Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and not only excelled on the competition dataset but also outperformed a newer algorithm. This finding is significant as it could influence future logistics strategies and vehicle routing methods.",

    "eli12": "The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem is about finding the best routes for electric and hybrid delivery vehicles. Think of it like planning the quickest way to deliver pizza while keeping the delivery bike charged. This research could help make deliveries faster and greener, which matters as more companies switch to electric vehicles.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this study emphasizes the importance of efficient routing in logistics, especially with electric vehicles. The VNS method could lead to lower operational costs and better service delivery. Implementing such algorithms might enhance user satisfaction and environmental responsibility.",
    "engineer": "The paper discusses the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) applied to the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem, showing superior performance on the competition dataset. It outperformed a newer algorithm, highlighting VNS's potential for solving complex routing issues in logistics. This could encourage further exploration of metaheuristic approaches in EV routing."
