  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.17541v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper proposes a formal framework for evaluating artificial memory systems based on Leibniz's Monadology. It introduces the Artificial Age Score (AAS), linking twenty core propositions of Monadology to a mathematical architecture. Each 'monad' acts as a modular unit with metrics for memory aging and stability. This approach not only enhances evaluation methods but also provides a foundation for developing interpretable AI memory architectures, making it significant for the future of artificial intelligence.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and developers can better assess AI memory systems, improving performance and reliability in applications. This framework could lead to more trustworthy AI interactions.",
    "This work indicates a shift towards integrating philosophical concepts into AI design, suggesting that understanding human cognition could enhance machine learning strategies."

    "eli12": "This study connects a classic philosophical idea to modern AI, showing how Leibniz's thoughts can help us evaluate memory in machines. Think of it like using a recipe to bake a cake; the framework provides the ingredients for building better AI. This matters because it could lead to smarter, more reliable AI that understands and remembers information like we do.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework could reshape how AI products are designed and evaluated. By focusing on memory systems, teams can enhance user experience and efficiency. A practical implication is the potential for creating AI that learns more effectively, making it more valuable for users.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the framework utilizes an information-theoretic architecture where each monad is defined by specific metrics like truth score and redundancy. The study establishes key principles such as refinement invariance and monotonicity, which are crucial for memory evolution in AI systems. This rigorous approach offers a structured method to build AI memory architectures that are both modular and interpretable."
