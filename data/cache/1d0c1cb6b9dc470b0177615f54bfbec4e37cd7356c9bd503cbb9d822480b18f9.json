  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.26852v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools. However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced CATArena, a new evaluation platform for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, moving beyond fixed benchmarks to a tournament-style format. This framework emphasizes learning capabilities through peer interactions and open-ended scoring, which helps address issues of score saturation. By allowing agents to continuously refine their strategies, CATArena promises a more dynamic assessment of their evolving skills. This matters now as LLM agents are increasingly relied upon for complex tasks, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "CATArena provides immediate benefits for developers and researchers, enabling them to better assess and enhance LLM agents' learning abilities.",
    "This approach signals a shift in AI evaluation practices, moving from static benchmarks to more adaptive, competitive environments that reflect real-world applications."

    "eli12": "CATArena is like a sports tournament for AI agents, where they compete in games to improve their skills. Instead of just checking if they can perform tasks, this platform lets them learn from each other and get better over time. This matters to everyday people because it could lead to smarter AI tools that handle complex tasks more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers, CATArena highlights the need to evaluate AI tools not just on fixed tasks but on their ability to learn and adapt. This could improve user experience by ensuring that AI systems continuously evolve. A practical implication is that products using LLMs could become more efficient and capable as they learn from interactions.",
    "engineer": "CATArena introduces a competitive framework that allows LLM agents to enhance their learning abilities through peer interactions. It utilizes four board and card games with open-ended scoring, addressing score saturation in traditional benchmarks. This innovative approach could lead to more reliable evaluations of agent capabilities, particularly in learning and strategy development."
