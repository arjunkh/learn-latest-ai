  "speedrun": "Technology leaders are focusing on enhancing trust in agentic AI for finance workflows. In the last two years, many companies have integrated automated agents into areas like customer support and back-office operations. While these tools are good at fetching information, they often lack the ability to deliver consistent and understandable reasoning, especially in complex tasks. This issue is crucial now as businesses increasingly rely on AI to streamline operations and improve service quality.",

    "eli12": "Imagine using a smart assistant that can find answers but often can't explain how it reached them. That's the challenge with agentic AI in finance. As companies rely more on these technologies, they need to ensure that the AI can be trusted to provide clear and consistent explanations. This matters because it affects how comfortable people feel using AI in their daily financial tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, enhancing trust in AI means addressing user needs for clarity and reliability. If automated agents can explain their reasoning, they could reduce user frustration and improve efficiency. This focus could lead to better adoption rates and ultimately drive business success.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, improving agentic AI involves refining the models that underpin these tools. Currently, they excel at information retrieval but struggle with multi-step reasoning. Addressing this gap could involve integrating advanced natural language processing techniques to enhance explainability and consistency in outputs, which is essential for financial applications."
