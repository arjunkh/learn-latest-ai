  "speedrun": "Lithium prices are set to be a focal point in 2026, driven by rising demand in electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage. Analysts predict a significant increase in lithium production, with estimates suggesting a 40% rise in global supply by 2025. This matters now as countries and companies pivot towards sustainable energy, making lithium a key player in the transition to greener technologies.",

    "eli12": "In 2026, lithium could be a hot topic because it’s essential for batteries in electric cars and renewable energy. Imagine trying to power a city with a limited supply of batteries—this is what’s at stake. As more people switch to electric vehicles, the demand for lithium will likely soar, affecting everything from car prices to energy costs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding lithium's market dynamics is crucial. As demand for electric vehicles grows, the need for efficient supply chains and cost-effective sourcing of lithium could directly impact product pricing and availability. Keeping an eye on lithium trends could help in strategic planning and competitive positioning.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the lithium supply chain is expected to expand by 40% by 2025, which could enhance battery production capabilities. However, this growth could be challenged by extraction and processing limitations. Engineers should consider these factors when developing battery technologies and systems that rely on lithium."
