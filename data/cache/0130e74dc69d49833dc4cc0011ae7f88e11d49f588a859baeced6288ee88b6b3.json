  "speedrun": "A new guide outlines how to create an evaluation pipeline for large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. It emphasizes the importance of systematic assessment to ensure reliability and effectiveness. The guide includes practical steps and considerations for developers. This matters now as businesses increasingly rely on LLMs, making effective evaluation crucial for success.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can improve LLM performance, leading to better user experiences and outcomes in applications like customer service.",
    "The guide reflects a growing focus on accountability and transparency in AI, which could reshape industry standards and practices."

    "eli12": "The guide helps developers understand how to check if their AI models are working well. Think of it like a quality check for a car before it hits the road. This is important because better evaluations lead to more reliable AI that can help people in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this guide highlights the need for robust evaluation processes to meet user expectations. It suggests that investing in evaluation could enhance product efficiency and user satisfaction. A practical takeaway is to incorporate these evaluation steps early in the development cycle.",
    "engineer": "The guide details steps for building an evaluation pipeline tailored for LLMs, focusing on metrics like accuracy and response time. It encourages using benchmarks to compare model performance, ensuring the chosen model meets specific application needs. This systematic approach can mitigate risks associated with deploying LLMs."
