    "eli12": "A comparison showed that ChatGPT might not be using the real GPT-5, as it gave wrong answers while Microsoft's Copilot worked well. This is important because it means people might not be getting the best AI help they need.",
    "pm": "Businesses using ChatGPT for tasks may face challenges if the tool lacks accuracy compared to competitors like Copilot. This situation presents an opportunity for companies to reassess their AI tools and potentially switch to more reliable options, while also posing a risk to OpenAI's reputation.",
    "engineer": "The analysis indicates that ChatGPT may be operating on a modified or less capable version of GPT-5, affecting its performance in data extraction tasks. This raises concerns about the underlying architecture and training methods used, suggesting limitations in its ability to deliver accurate information reliably."
