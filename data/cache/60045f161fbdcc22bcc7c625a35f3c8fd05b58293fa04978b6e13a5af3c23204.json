  "speedrun": "In the world of data storytelling, a significant challenge arises when clear dashboards clash with stakeholders' desires for comprehensive information. Many stakeholders prefer having all data on a single screen, which can complicate the message. This tension often leads to cluttered visuals that obscure key insights. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for effective communication in data-driven environments.",

    "Data analysts may face pushback from stakeholders, making it harder to convey important insights clearly.",
    "This situation reflects a broader trend where organizations struggle to balance simplicity and complexity in data presentation."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to read a book while someone keeps adding more pages. That's what data storytellers face when stakeholders want all the details at once. This clash can make it hard for everyday people to grasp important information. Finding a balance between clarity and detail could help everyone understand data better.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this highlights the need to prioritize user experience in data presentation. Stakeholders often want a lot of information, but that can lead to confusion. Focusing on simplicity could enhance decision-making and improve product usability. It’s about finding the right balance between detail and clarity.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the challenge lies in designing dashboards that effectively present data without overwhelming users. Using models that prioritize key metrics while allowing for deeper dives into data can help. However, engineers must consider how to maintain clarity while accommodating the request for comprehensive information."
