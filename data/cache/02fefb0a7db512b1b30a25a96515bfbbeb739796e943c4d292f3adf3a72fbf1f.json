  "raw_body": "Claude Cowork is now available to more Claude users, alongside new updates aimed at team workflows.\nAnthropic made Claude Cowork accessible to users on Team and Enterprise plans, and it brings the platform closer to being a collaborative AI infrastructure. For enterprise teams, the change matters less as a feature update than as a shift in how Claude is meant to be used. Cowork reframes Claude as a shared, persistent workspace where context, files, and tasks live beyond a single user session. This aligns more closely with how teams actually operate than one-off chat interactions.\nCowork, released earlier in January, lets people complete non-technical tasks in the same asynchronous way they use Claude Code. It was initially limited to Claude Max subscribers. \n\nEnterprise and Teams users who can access Claude Cowork can begin building workflows for their non-technical, or no-code, projects and even create entirely new files within the folders they have access to. However, Anthropic did not say whether Cowork projects or files are transferable between users, even within the same Enterprise or Team plan.\nThat uncertainty could matter for enterprises evaluating Cowork as a system of record rather than a personal productivity tool. Questions around ownership, access, and continuity — such as what happens to shared AI-generated work when an employee leaves — are increasingly central as organizations move AI into production workflows. Now that more people across Claude’s paid tiers can use Cowork, Anthropic is extending AI-assisted workflows beyond developers and into broader teams.\nAs more teams experiment with AI-assisted workflows, tools originally designed for coding are increasingly being repurposed for coordination, documentation, and task execution. Anthropic said Claude Cowork emerged after engineers noticed users stretching Claude Code beyond development and into broader, asynchronous workflows.\nEven though Claude Cowork is still in research preview, Anthropic also added new features to the tool. \nThe first lets people “@-mention projects to bring context into Cowork sessions, and Claude in Chrome now shows live screenshots as it works.” It allows people to avoid switching windows when adding more information to the Cowork task. \nThe second new feature allows onboarding of new vendors at scale. \n\nBoth features should make it easier for teams to share and expand new tasks. Together, the updates point to Cowork’s role as shared infrastructure for ongoing work, rather than a transient chat interface.",

  "speedrun": "Anthropic has expanded access to Claude Cowork, making it available to users on Team and Enterprise plans. This update transforms Claude into a collaborative AI infrastructure, allowing teams to manage workflows and tasks in a shared workspace. Unlike traditional chat tools, Cowork enables persistent context and content that can enhance team productivity. This shift is significant as it aligns AI capabilities more closely with how teams actually work together.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Teams can now utilize Claude Cowork for ongoing projects, facilitating smoother collaboration and task management.",
    "This change reflects a broader trend of integrating AI into team workflows, moving beyond individual use cases to support collective productivity."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Claude Cowork is like a shared digital desk where team members can work together on projects. Instead of just chatting, they can store files and tasks in one place, making it easier to collaborate. This matters because it helps teams work more efficiently and keeps everything organized, so no one loses track of important information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Claude Cowork addresses the need for collaborative tools in AI workflows. By enabling teams to create and manage projects together, it could reduce the time spent on coordination. A practical implication is the potential for improved efficiency in task execution, allowing teams to focus on delivering results rather than managing communication.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Claude Cowork enhances the functionality of the Claude platform by allowing asynchronous project management. It supports non-technical tasks, expanding its use beyond coding to include broader team workflows. However, questions remain about file transferability and ownership, which could impact its adoption in enterprise settings."
