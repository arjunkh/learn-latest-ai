  "speedrun": "The article introduces Ray, a framework designed to simplify distributed computing, allowing users to harness the power of multiple cores on their machines and scale beyond. It highlights Ray's ability to manage resources efficiently, making it easier to run complex computations. This is significant as it democratizes access to distributed computing, which was previously limited to experts. Now, more users can leverage this technology for their projects.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers and data scientists can now utilize distributed computing without deep expertise, speeding up their workflows.",
    "This shift could lead to broader innovation, as more people can tackle complex problems using distributed systems."

    "eli12": "Ray is like a traffic manager for computers, helping them work together smoothly. Instead of one car (or core) doing all the work, many can share the load. This matters for everyday people because it means faster apps and better technology without needing a computer science degree.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Ray could streamline development processes and reduce costs by enabling efficient resource allocation. This means teams can build more complex features faster, meeting user needs without overextending budgets.",
    "engineer": "Ray simplifies distributed computing by allowing seamless scaling from a single core to multiple cores across machines. It uses a task execution model that can manage resources efficiently, which is crucial for performance. This could enable engineers to tackle larger datasets and complex algorithms with less overhead."
