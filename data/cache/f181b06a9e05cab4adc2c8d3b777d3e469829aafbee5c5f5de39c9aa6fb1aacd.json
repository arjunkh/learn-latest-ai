    "eli12": "Think of this new DeepSeek as a smaller, more efficient toolbox for solving complex problems. Just like a compact toolset can help you fix things faster, this AI model could streamline decision-making in various fields. It matters because it makes advanced technology more available to everyday users and researchers alike.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a user need for more efficient and accessible AI tools. A smaller model like DeepSeek could reduce costs and improve application performance. This means businesses could integrate advanced reasoning capabilities without the burden of heavy computational resources.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the de-censoring and size reduction of DeepSeek R1 could enhance its reasoning capabilities while maintaining performance. If the model retains its original benchmarks, it could serve as a more efficient alternative for complex tasks. However, the article does not specify any limitations or trade-offs associated with this new version."
