  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.21204v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new method to enhance how large language models (LLMs) handle instructional dialogue. They developed a symbolic scaffolding mechanism combined with a short-term memory schema, leading to improved reasoning in tutoring scenarios. Preliminary results show that their complete system outperformed baseline models significantly. This matters now as it suggests that specific architectural designs can enhance the cognitive abilities of LLMs, making them more effective in educational contexts.",

    "eli12": "Imagine teaching a child with a structured guide versus just letting them explore freely. This research shows that adding a framework helps LLMs reason better in tutoring roles. By improving how these models think and respond, we could see better educational tools that support learning more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the need for thoughtful design in AI tools. A focus on scaffolding and memory could lead to more efficient user interactions, making educational products more effective. Implementing these insights could enhance user satisfaction and engagement.",
    "engineer": "The study utilizes a symbolic scaffolding mechanism and short-term memory schema to improve LLM performance in instructional dialogue. Controlled experiments across five system variants revealed that removing these structures negatively impacted cognitive behaviors like abstraction and conceptual continuity. These findings underscore the importance of architectural choices in shaping LLM capabilities."
