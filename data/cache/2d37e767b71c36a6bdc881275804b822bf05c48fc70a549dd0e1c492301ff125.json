  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.22831v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze \"1-back attention heads\" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper explores how findings from one Large Language Model (LLM) can apply to others, addressing a key challenge in mechanistic interpretability. It identifies five axes of generalizability, such as functional and developmental similarities. The study shows that larger Pythia models exhibit earlier and more pronounced attention patterns. This research is crucial as it could help unify understanding across different LLMs, making them more interpretable and reliable.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and developers will benefit from clearer guidelines on how to apply findings across different LLMs, enhancing interpretability. This could lead to better model design and performance.",
    "This study may signal a shift in LLM research, focusing on the underlying mechanisms that drive behavior rather than just surface-level performance metrics, which could reshape future AI development."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This paper looks at how we can understand why different AI models behave similarly or differently. It suggests five ways to compare them, like how they learn and interact. This is important because knowing how one model works could help us predict how others will behave, making AI more trustworthy and easier to use in daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of understanding the foundational behaviors of LLMs. By focusing on generalizability, teams could save time and resources when developing new models. This could lead to more efficient product iterations and a better alignment with user needs.",
    "engineer": "The study employs a framework to evaluate mechanistic claims across LLMs, focusing on axes like developmental and positional similarities. Analysis of Pythia models reveals that larger models exhibit earlier and steeper attention patterns, indicating a systematic relationship between model size and attention behavior. This insight could inform future model design and optimization strategies."
