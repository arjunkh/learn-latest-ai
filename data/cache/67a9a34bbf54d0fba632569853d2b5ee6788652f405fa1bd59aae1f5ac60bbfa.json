  "speedrun": "Perplexity, an AI search vendor, secured a licensing deal with Getty Images, gaining access to its vast visual media library. However, unlike other agreements, Perplexity cannot use Getty's content to train its AI model. This distinction could reshape how AI companies approach licensing, as it highlights the ongoing tension between content creators and AI developers over data usage rights.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This deal impacts AI search vendors directly, limiting their ability to enhance models with licensed content.",
    "It signals a broader industry shift towards stricter licensing agreements, potentially affecting how AI firms innovate and compete."

    "eli12": "Perplexity's new deal with Getty Images allows access to images but not for training AI. Think of it like borrowing a book to read but not being able to take notes from it. This matters because it could change how AI tools are built and what they can do for us.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this deal illustrates the importance of understanding content licensing. With limitations on training data, teams may need to find alternative ways to enhance their AI's capabilities. This could lead to increased costs or delays in product development.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Perplexity's inability to train on Getty's content means it must rely on existing models and datasets. This could limit the model's performance compared to competitors who may have broader access to training data. It emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to model training without extensive datasets."
