  "speedrun": "Many organizations struggle to move AI projects from pilot phases to full-scale implementation. Although generative models are widely tested, integrating them with governance and security often slows progress. IBM is addressing this issue with a new service model aimed at bridging the gap between investment and operational return. This matters now as companies seek to maximize the value of their AI investments amid growing competition.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations looking to scale AI can benefit from IBM's new service, which provides essential governance and integration support.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend where businesses prioritize operationalizing AI, moving beyond experimentation to achieve real-world impact."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Many companies are stuck in the 'pilot phase' of AI, where they test ideas but don't implement them widely. Think of it like having a great recipe but never cooking the meal. IBM's new service could help these companies actually use AI effectively, which is important for everyday people as it means better services and products in the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights the need to focus on not just creating AI solutions but also ensuring they can be integrated and governed effectively. IBM's new service could help reduce costs and improve efficiency by providing the necessary support for scaling AI. This means teams can focus more on innovation rather than getting stuck in operational hurdles.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the challenge lies in integrating generative models with robust governance and security frameworks. IBM's service model aims to streamline this process, potentially enhancing operational returns on AI investments. However, organizations must still consider the complexities of implementation and the specific requirements of their existing systems."
