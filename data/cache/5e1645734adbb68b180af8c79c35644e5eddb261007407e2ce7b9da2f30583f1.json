  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.25244v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor. Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \\$50,000 to \\$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative research's humanistic commitments.\n  Keywords: Grounded theory; Vector embeddings; Multi agent systems; Human AI collaboration; Computational qualitative analysis",

  "speedrun": "Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) merges vector clustering with multi-agent systems to enhance qualitative research. It analyzed 40,000-character Chinese interview transcripts, achieving a remarkable 168-fold speed improvement, reducing analysis time from three weeks to just three hours. This method not only cuts costs from $50,000 to $500 but also maintains high interpretive quality. This innovation could democratize qualitative research, allowing more communities to engage in self-study.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers can now analyze large qualitative datasets quickly and affordably, making insights more accessible to diverse groups.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend where computational methods enhance traditional research, blending efficiency with human interpretation."

    "eli12": "Neo Grounded Theory is like having a super-smart assistant that can sort through a mountain of information in record time. Instead of taking weeks to analyze interviews, researchers can now get results in hours. This innovation could help everyday people understand complex issues by making research faster and cheaper, allowing more voices to be heard.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Neo Grounded Theory offers a new way to gather user insights quickly and cost-effectively. With analysis time slashed and costs reduced, teams could focus more on actionable results rather than lengthy coding processes. This could lead to faster iterations and improved products that better meet user needs.",
    "engineer": "The technical foundation of Neo Grounded Theory involves 1536-dimensional embeddings and hierarchical clustering, which enable efficient pattern recognition in qualitative data. In experiments, NGT outperformed manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis, achieving a quality score of 0.904 compared to 0.883. This approach highlights the potential for AI to complement human creativity in research, revealing insights that traditional methods might miss."
