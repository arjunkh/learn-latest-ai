  "raw_body": "Enterprise AI has a data problem. Despite billions in investment and increasingly capable language models, most organizations still can't answer basic analytical questions about their document repositories. The culprit isn't model quality but architecture: Traditional retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems were designed to retrieve and summarize, not analyze and aggregate across large document sets.\nSnowflake is tackling this limitation head-on with a comprehensive platform strategy announced at its BUILD 2025 conference. The company unveiled Snowflake Intelligence, an enterprise intelligence agent platform designed to unify structured and unstructured data analysis, along with infrastructure improvements spanning data integration with Openflow, database consolidation with Snowflake Postgres and real-time analytics with interactive tables. The goal: Eliminate the data silos and architectural bottlenecks that prevent enterprises from operationalizing AI at scale.\nA key innovation is Agentic Document Analytics, a new capability within Snowflake Intelligence that can analyze thousands of documents simultaneously. This moves enterprises from basic lookups like \"What is our password reset policy?\" to complex analytical queries like \"Show me a count of weekly mentions by product area in my customer support tickets for the last six months.\"\nThe RAG bottleneck: Why sampling fails for analytics\nTraditional RAG systems work by embedding documents into vector representations, storing them in a vector database and retrieving the most semantically similar documents when a user asks a question.\n\"For RAG to work, it requires that all of the answers that you are searching for already exist in some published way today,\" Jeff Hollan, head of Cortex AI Agents at Snowflake explained to VentureBeat during a press briefing. \"The pattern I think about with RAG is it's like a librarian, you get a question and it tells you, 'This book has the answer on this specific page.'\"\nHowever, this architecture fundamentally breaks when organizations need to perform aggregate analysis. If, for example, an enterprise has 100,000 reports and wants to identify all of the reports that talk about a specific business entity and sum up all the revenue discussed in those reports, that's a non-trivial task.\n\"That's a much more complex thing than just traditional RAG,\" Hollan said.\nThis limitation has typically forced enterprises to maintain separate analytics pipelines for structured data in data warehouses and unstructured data in vector databases or document stores. The result is data silos and governance challenges for enterprises.\nHow Agentic Document Analytics works differently\nSnowflake's approach unifies structured and unstructured data analysis within its platform by treating documents as queryable data sources rather than retrieval targets. The system uses AI to extract, structure and index document content in ways that enable SQL-like analytical operations across thousands of documents.\nThe capability leverages Snowflake's existing architecture. Cortex AISQL handles document parsing and extraction. Interactive Tables and Warehouses deliver sub-second query performance on large datasets. By processing documents within the same governed data platform that houses structured data, enterprises can join document insights with transactional data, customer records and other business information.\n\"The value of AI, the power of AI, the productivity and disruptive potential of AI, is created and enabled by connecting with enterprise data,\" said Christian Kleinerman, EVP of product at Snowflake. \nThe company's architecture keeps all data processing within its security boundary, addressing governance concerns that have slowed enterprise AI adoption. The system works with documents across multiple sources. These include PDFs in SharePoint, Slack conversations, Microsoft Teams data and Salesforce records through Snowflake's zero-copy integration capabilities. This eliminates the need to extract and move data into separate AI processing systems.\nComparison with current market approaches\nThe announcement positions Snowflake differently from both traditional data warehouse vendors and AI-native startups. \nCompanies like Databricks have focused on bringing AI capabilities to lakehouses, but typically still rely on vector databases and traditional RAG patterns for unstructured data. OpenAI's Assistants API and Anthropic's Claude both offer document analysis, but are limited by context window sizes.\nVector database providers like Pinecone and Weaviate have built businesses around RAG use cases but sometimes face challenges when customers need analytical queries rather than retrieval-based ones. These systems excel at finding relevant documents but cannot easily aggregate information across large document sets.\nAmong the key high-value use cases that were previously difficult with RAG-only architectures that Snowflow highlights for its approach is customer support analysis. Instead of manually reviewing support tickets, organizations can query patterns across thousands of interactions. Questions like \"What are the top 10 product issues mentioned in support tickets this quarter, broken down by customer segment?\" become answerable in seconds.\nWhat this means for enterprise AI strategy\nFor enterprises building AI strategies, Agentic Document Analytics represents a shift from the \"search and retrieve\" paradigm of RAG to a \"query and analyze\" paradigm more familiar from business intelligence tools. \nRather than deploying separate vector databases and RAG systems for each use case, enterprises can consolidate document analytics into their existing data platform. This reduces infrastructure complexity while extending business intelligence practices to unstructured data.\nThe capability also democratizes access. Making document analysis queryable through natural language means insights that previously required data science teams become available to business users.\nFor enterprises looking to lead in AI, the competitive advantage comes not from having better language models, but from analyzing proprietary unstructured data at scale alongside structured business data. Organizations that can query their entire document corpus as easily as they query their data warehouse will gain insights competitors cannot easily replicate.\n\"AI is a reality today,\" Kleinerman said. \"We have lots of organizations already getting value out of AI, and if anyone is still waiting it out or sitting on the sidelines, our call to action is to start building now.\"",

    "eli12": "Snowflake's new platform helps businesses analyze lots of documents at once, rather than just finding specific answers. Think of it like a chef who can not only find a recipe but also combine ingredients to create a new dish. This matters because it makes powerful data insights accessible to everyone, not just data experts.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Snowflake's approach means they can streamline data processes by integrating document analysis into existing platforms. This could reduce costs and improve efficiency by eliminating separate systems for different data types. The practical implication is that teams can gain insights faster, driving better product decisions.",
    "engineer": "Snowflake's Agentic Document Analytics leverages AI for document parsing and indexing, enabling SQL-like operations across large datasets. By integrating with existing architectures, it processes diverse data sources within a unified platform, addressing governance issues. Unlike traditional RAG systems, this approach allows for aggregate analysis, making it suitable for complex queries across extensive document collections."
