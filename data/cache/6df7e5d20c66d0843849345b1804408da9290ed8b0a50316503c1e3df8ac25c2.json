  "raw_excerpt": "Google just announced that a typical query to its Gemini app uses about 0.24 watt-hours of electricity. That’s about the same as running a microwave for one second—something that, to me, feels virtually insignificant. I run the microwave for so many more seconds than that on most days.

  "speedrun": "Google revealed that a typical query to its Gemini app consumes around 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, comparable to running a microwave for just one second. This figure seems minor, especially since many people use microwaves for longer periods daily. However, understanding energy consumption in AI is crucial as it raises awareness about the environmental impact of technology. As AI becomes more prevalent, knowing its energy footprint could influence future developments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This information is important for tech users who are increasingly concerned about energy consumption and sustainability in their daily tech use.",
    "It highlights a broader trend in the tech industry where understanding energy efficiency could shape the future of AI development and deployment."

    "eli12": "Google's report shows that using its Gemini app takes about as much energy as running a microwave for just one second. That’s a tiny amount, similar to how we might not think twice about turning on a light for a moment. Knowing these details helps people understand how technology impacts the environment. As we use more AI, being aware of energy use could help us make smarter choices.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this energy consumption insight could inform decisions about app design and user experience. Understanding that a typical query uses 0.24 watt-hours might lead to exploring more efficient algorithms. This could improve user satisfaction and reduce operational costs, making products more appealing in an eco-conscious market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the 0.24 watt-hours per query for Gemini suggests a focus on energy efficiency in AI models. This figure allows engineers to benchmark performance against other applications and optimize energy use. However, a comprehensive understanding of AI's total energy footprint remains essential, as this single metric does not capture the entire picture."
