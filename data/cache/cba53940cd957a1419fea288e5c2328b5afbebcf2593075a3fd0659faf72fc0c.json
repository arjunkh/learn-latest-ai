  "speedrun": "Bain & Company has released a report highlighting that many Southeast Asian organizations are lagging in AI adoption, still viewing it merely as a set of tools. Their new guide emphasizes that CEOs need to rethink AI as a transformative business strategy. This shift is crucial as companies risk falling behind if they don't adapt to the evolving landscape of AI integration. The launch of a new hub in Singapore signals Bain's commitment to supporting this transition.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "CEOs in Southeast Asia may feel immediate pressure to rethink their AI strategies, potentially reshaping their operational frameworks.",
    "This report reflects a broader trend where companies globally are realizing that AI is not just a tool, but a fundamental shift in business processes."

    "eli12": "Bain & Company's new report shows that many businesses in Southeast Asia are not using AI effectively. Instead of seeing AI as a way to change how they work, they treat it like just another tool. This is important because, like a chef who only uses a knife but doesn’t learn to cook, companies could miss out on the full benefits of AI. Understanding AI's role could help everyday people enjoy better services and products.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Bain's report highlights a critical user need: recognizing AI as a transformative strategy rather than just a tool. This perspective could lead to more innovative products and services that align with evolving market demands. By embracing AI holistically, companies may enhance efficiency and reduce costs, ultimately improving their competitive edge.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, Bain's report underscores the importance of integrating AI into core business processes rather than treating it as an add-on. This approach encourages companies to adopt advanced AI models that can drive significant operational improvements. However, organizations must be cautious about the early-stage testing phase, as it could hinder their ability to leverage AI's full potential in real-world applications."
