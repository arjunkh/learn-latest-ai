As ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics $\\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded, frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases exist for $\\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu L}$, $\\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs, and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full, frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.",
