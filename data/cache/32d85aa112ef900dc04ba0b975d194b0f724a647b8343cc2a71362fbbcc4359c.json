  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.19836v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) to evaluate reasoning reliability in AI models used for energy system analysis. This framework assesses models like GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, which scored over 90 on the Analytical Reliability Index, indicating strong reasoning capabilities. In contrast, Llama 3 70B fell short of professional standards. This development is crucial as it provides a standardized way to ensure AI systems can make reliable decisions in energy policy and optimization.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Energy analysts and policymakers benefit from more reliable AI tools, ensuring better decision-making based on sound reasoning. The ARB helps verify that AI outputs are trustworthy.",
    "The introduction of ARB signals a shift towards more rigorous standards in AI applications across the energy sector, promoting transparency and accountability in model performance."

    "eli12": "The new Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) helps check if AI models can reason correctly, not just predict outcomes. Think of it like a quality control check for a factory, ensuring products meet safety standards. This matters because reliable AI can lead to better energy decisions that affect everyoneâ€™s lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in the energy sector, the ARB provides a way to assess AI tools beyond just accuracy. This could lead to more efficient decision-making processes and lower risks associated with policy design. The emphasis on reasoning reliability may also attract more users seeking trustworthy solutions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the ARB evaluates AI models using five submetrics, focusing on reasoning reliability and policy consistency. Models like GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet showed over 90 on the Analytical Reliability Index, indicating high reliability. This benchmark allows engineers to compare model performance consistently, ensuring that AI systems can effectively handle complex energy scenarios."
