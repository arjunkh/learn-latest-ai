  "speedrun": "RavenDB is addressing common challenges in database technologies by aiming to provide performance, flexibility, and security without forcing users to compromise. Traditionally, users had to choose two out of three, often facing manual tuning for speed or constraints from early designs. With RavenDB, the goal is to streamline these aspects, making it easier for businesses to focus on strategy rather than technical limitations. This matters now as companies increasingly rely on efficient data management for competitive advantage.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses can benefit from streamlined data management, reducing the technical burden on teams and allowing them to focus on strategic goals.",
    "This shift could indicate a broader trend towards integrated solutions in the database market, where ease of use and efficiency become key differentiators."

    "eli12": "RavenDB is trying to make databases easier to use by combining speed, flexibility, and security. Think of it like a Swiss Army knife that doesn’t make you choose between tools. This is important for everyday people because it means businesses can manage data more effectively, leading to better services and products.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, RavenDB could simplify the data management process, reducing the need for extensive manual tuning. This could lower costs and improve efficiency, allowing teams to allocate resources toward innovation rather than maintenance. The practical implication is that products can be developed faster and with fewer technical headaches.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, RavenDB aims to balance performance and flexibility without compromising security. This could mean less manual tuning for speed and fewer constraints from initial designs. Engineers might find that this approach allows for more agile development cycles and easier integration into existing systems."
