    "eli12": "OpenAI's research reveals why AI can sometimes make things up instead of providing accurate answers. By improving how we check these AIs, we could make them more trustworthy and safer. This matters because as people increasingly depend on AI for information, it's important they can trust what it says.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding why language models hallucinate is essential for improving user experience. By focusing on better evaluation methods, companies could enhance the reliability of their AI products, potentially reducing customer dissatisfaction and increasing trust. This could also lead to more efficient development cycles as inaccuracies are addressed earlier.",
    "engineer": "The research delves into the mechanisms behind hallucinations in language models, highlighting the importance of evaluation metrics in assessing model performance. By refining these metrics, engineers could enhance model accuracy and safety, reducing instances of misinformation. Such improvements could lead to more robust AI systems capable of handling complex queries with greater reliability."
