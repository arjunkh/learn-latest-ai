  "speedrun": "The article discusses how to effectively use Multi-Attribute Decision Matrices (MADM) for making complex decisions. It highlights the importance of structuring choices to identify the most efficient options, emphasizing that misleading value metrics can skew results. By applying a clear framework, decision-makers can better evaluate alternatives and avoid common pitfalls. This is particularly relevant now as organizations face increasingly complex choices in a fast-paced environment.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Decision-makers can streamline their processes by using structured matrices, leading to quicker and more accurate outcomes.",
    "As businesses navigate complex choices, adopting effective decision-making frameworks could enhance competitiveness and adaptability."

    "eli12": "Multi-Attribute Decision Matrices help people make choices by breaking down options into clear criteria. Think of it like a shopping list that helps you compare products based on what matters most to you. This approach matters because it can save time and reduce stress when facing tough decisions in daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, using MADMs can clarify user needs and prioritize features based on multiple criteria. This structured approach can lead to more efficient resource allocation and better alignment with user expectations. A practical implication is that it could help teams avoid costly missteps by ensuring decisions are based on comprehensive evaluations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, MADMs allow for systematic evaluation of alternatives by quantifying various attributes. This method can incorporate models like weighted scoring to prioritize options based on their importance. However, care must be taken to ensure that the metrics used are relevant and accurately reflect the decision context."
