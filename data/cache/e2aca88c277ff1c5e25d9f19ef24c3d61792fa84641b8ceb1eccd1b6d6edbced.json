    "eli12": "Hugging Face Spaces makes it simple for people to share their apps, similar to how sharing photos on social media works. Just like you can post a picture with a click, developers can now showcase their projects easily. This is important because it encourages more people to share their creations, leading to a richer community of ideas and innovations.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Hugging Face Spaces represents a valuable tool for user engagement. It addresses the need for easy app deployment while minimizing costs associated with hosting. By leveraging this platform, teams could enhance their product visibility and gather user feedback more efficiently.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Hugging Face Spaces simplifies the deployment process for machine learning applications, allowing developers to use frameworks like Streamlit with minimal effort. This could lead to faster iterations and testing of ideas. However, users should be aware of any limitations in terms of resource allocation or performance compared to traditional hosting services."
