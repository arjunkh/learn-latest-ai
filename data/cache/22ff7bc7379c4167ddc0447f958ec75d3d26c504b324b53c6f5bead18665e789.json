    "eli12": "The article suggests that instead of aiming for billion-dollar valuations, entrepreneurs should focus on building solid, reliable businesses. Think of it like planting a tree that grows steadily instead of a firework that bursts and fades. This matters because it encourages everyday people to support businesses that prioritize stability over hype.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means adjusting strategies to focus on user needs and sustainable growth. It could lead to lower costs and more efficient operations. A practical implication is that teams might prioritize features that enhance customer retention rather than just attracting new users.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the article highlights the importance of building scalable and resilient systems rather than pursuing rapid growth at all costs. This could involve adopting robust architectures that ensure reliability. Engineers might need to focus more on efficiency metrics and long-term performance rather than just short-term gains."
