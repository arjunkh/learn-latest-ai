  "speedrun": "Madonna Yoder, a 2017 graduate, discovered the art of folding paper at a young age, which led to the creation of intricate designs like a flapping crane after about 16 folds. This simple act of folding transformed her understanding of creativity and craftsmanship. The significance of her journey lies in how such childhood experiences can inspire innovation and artistic expression in adults, emphasizing the value of hands-on learning.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For young learners, hands-on activities like paper folding can enhance creativity and problem-solving skills, making learning more engaging.",
    "This trend reflects a broader shift towards valuing experiential learning in education, encouraging innovative thinking and practical skill development."

    "eli12": "Madonna Yoder's experience with paper folding shows how simple activities can spark creativity. Like building blocks for the mind, these hands-on experiences can help us think outside the box. This matters because it highlights the importance of play and creativity in learning, which can benefit everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this story illustrates the importance of engaging users through hands-on experiences. By creating products that allow for creativity and exploration, they could meet user needs more effectively. This approach could lead to innovative solutions that resonate with users on a deeper level.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Yoder's folding technique can be seen as a form of algorithmic thinking, where a simple process yields complex results. The iterative nature of folding mirrors optimization processes in engineering, showing how repeated actions can lead to refined outcomes. This highlights the potential for applying such principles in various engineering challenges."
