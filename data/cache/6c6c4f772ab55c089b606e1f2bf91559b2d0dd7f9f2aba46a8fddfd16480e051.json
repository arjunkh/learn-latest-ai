  "speedrun": "The article discusses how to assess the retrieval quality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using graded measures like DCG@k and NDCG@k. These metrics help evaluate how well a system retrieves relevant information based on user queries. Understanding these metrics is crucial for improving AI systems that rely on retrieving information from large datasets. As AI continues to evolve, ensuring high retrieval quality will enhance user experience and accuracy in responses.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For developers, using DCG@k and NDCG@k can directly improve the relevance of information retrieved for user queries, enhancing satisfaction.",
    "This reflects a broader trend in AI towards more nuanced evaluations, pushing the industry to focus on quality over mere quantity in data retrieval."

    "eli12": "Evaluating how well AI retrieves information is like grading a student’s test: it's not just about getting the right answers but also how well they understand the material. DCG@k and NDCG@k are tools to measure this understanding in AI systems. This matters to everyday people because better retrieval means more accurate and helpful responses from AI, making technology more reliable.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding DCG@k and NDCG@k can help refine AI features that rely on information retrieval. These metrics highlight user needs for relevant and accurate responses. This can lead to improved user engagement and satisfaction, ultimately driving product success.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, DCG@k and NDCG@k are essential metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of retrieval algorithms in RAG pipelines. They assess how well the system ranks relevant documents, with NDCG accounting for the position of relevant results. Implementing these metrics can lead to more efficient retrieval processes, though care must be taken to interpret results in the context of specific use cases."
