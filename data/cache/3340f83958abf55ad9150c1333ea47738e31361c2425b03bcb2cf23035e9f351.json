    "eli12": "The NYT's lawsuit against Perplexity shows how publishers want to get paid for their content used by AI. Think of it like musicians wanting royalties when their songs are played on the radio. This is important for everyday people because it could affect the quality and availability of news and information online.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this situation highlights a growing user need for ethical content sourcing. Companies might face higher costs if they have to negotiate with publishers for content rights. A practical implication is that businesses may need to rethink their content strategies to ensure compliance and maintain good relationships with creators.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the lawsuit raises questions about the datasets used to train models like Perplexity. If publishers succeed, it could lead to increased costs for acquiring data or changes in model training practices. Understanding these legal dynamics is crucial for engineers as they develop AI systems that could be impacted by new regulations."
