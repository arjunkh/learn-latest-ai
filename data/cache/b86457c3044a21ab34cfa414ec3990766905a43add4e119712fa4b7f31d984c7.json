    "engineer": "The latest studies indicate that vitamin D plays a significant role in calcium regulation and immune system support. Understanding its mechanisms could lead to better recommendations for supplementation, particularly in populations with limited sun exposure. However, more research is needed to determine optimal dosages and long-term effects."
