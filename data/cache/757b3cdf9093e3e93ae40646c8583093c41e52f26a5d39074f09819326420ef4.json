  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.16012v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.",

    "eli12": "The new CaR framework helps neural networks solve routing problems more efficiently, especially when facing tough constraints. Think of it like a GPS that not only finds the quickest route but also avoids roadblocks. This matters because it could lead to faster and more reliable solutions in everyday logistics and transportation.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, CaR addresses a key user need for efficient routing solutions under complex constraints. By reducing the steps needed for solution improvement from 5,000 to just 10, it could significantly lower operational costs and enhance user experience. This efficiency might allow for quicker iterations and better product performance.",
    "engineer": "CaR introduces a novel approach to constraint handling in neural solvers, utilizing a joint training framework for construction and improvement.
