    "eli12": "AI is now widely used in businesses, with 78% already integrating it into their operations. The next big step is agentic AI, which can act more independently. Think of it like a self-driving car that makes decisions without constant human input. This matters because it could change how jobs are done and how we interact with technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of agentic AI presents a new user need for systems that balance autonomy with accountability. This could lead to more efficient processes, but it also raises questions about governance. Companies may need to invest in oversight mechanisms to ensure these AI systems align with business goals and ethical standards.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the shift toward agentic AI involves developing systems that can operate with more autonomy while ensuring accountability. This could require advancements in AI models that allow for better decision-making capabilities. However, it’s crucial to address the complexities of governance as these systems become more integrated into business functions."
