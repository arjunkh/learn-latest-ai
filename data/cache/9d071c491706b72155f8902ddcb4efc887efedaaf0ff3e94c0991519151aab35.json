  "speedrun": "MIT Technology Review recently revisited its Innovators Under 35, exploring how young researchers are navigating the changing landscape of US science and technology policy. Many are facing significant challenges in establishing their labs and advancing their work. With shifting funding and regulatory environments, these innovators must adapt quickly. This matters now as their success could influence future technological advancements and policy directions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Young researchers are directly impacted by changes in funding and policy, which could hinder their ability to innovate. This affects their research capabilities and future projects.",
    "At a broader level, these shifts signal a transformation in how science and technology are funded and regulated in the US, potentially reshaping the innovation landscape."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to build a treehouse, but the rules about where you can put it keep changing. Young innovators are facing similar challenges with their research due to new policies. This affects their ability to create and share new ideas. Understanding these changes is important for everyone, as it shapes the future of technology that we all use.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the evolving science policy landscape means they must stay attuned to funding opportunities and regulatory changes. These factors could affect the costs of research and development. Innovators may need to pivot their strategies or seek alternative funding sources to ensure their projects move forward.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, young researchers are navigating a landscape where funding and policy shifts can impact their access to resources and collaboration opportunities. This could affect the development of new models and technologies. Staying informed about these changes is crucial for engineers to align their projects with available support and regulatory frameworks."
