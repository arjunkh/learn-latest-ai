  "speedrun": "A recent comparison explored two methods for editing resumes: Prompt Engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The study highlighted that RAG could significantly enhance the quality of resume edits by leveraging external data sources. This matters now as job seekers increasingly rely on AI tools to stand out in competitive job markets.",

    "eli12": "The article compares two ways to edit resumes using AI. Prompt Engineering focuses on crafting specific prompts, while RAG pulls in information from other sources to improve edits. This is important for anyone looking to land a job, as it could make their resumes more appealing.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the effectiveness of RAG over Prompt Engineering could guide the development of more efficient resume editing tools. By meeting user needs for better job applications, these tools could save time and increase success rates for users.",
    "engineer": "The comparison shows that RAG can utilize external databases to enhance resume edits, potentially outperforming traditional Prompt Engineering methods. This approach could lead to more contextually relevant and polished resumes, though it may require careful integration of data sources."
