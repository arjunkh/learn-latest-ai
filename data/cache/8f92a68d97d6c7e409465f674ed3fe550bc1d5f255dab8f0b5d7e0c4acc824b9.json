  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.11822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores.\n  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights a significant issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) used as evaluators: they show a strong positive bias. While they accurately identify valid outputs 96% of the time, their ability to detect invalid ones drops below 25%. This bias can inflate reliability scores, complicating model selection for developers. The introduction of an optimal minority-veto strategy and a regression-based framework could enhance evaluation precision, which is crucial as new LLMs emerge frequently.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers relying on LLMs for evaluations may face misleading reliability scores, impacting their model choices and application quality.",
    "This research indicates a broader need for improved evaluation methods in AI, reflecting a shift towards more accurate and reliable AI assessments."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This study reveals that LLMs, while good at spotting correct outputs, struggle to flag incorrect ones, leading to skewed evaluations. Think of it like a teacher who gives high marks but misses mistakes. This matters because developers need trustworthy feedback to make informed choices about AI models.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this insight emphasizes the importance of accurate evaluations in AI tools. Developers could face challenges if relying solely on LLM evaluations, which may misrepresent model quality. Adopting the proposed minority-veto strategy could enhance user trust and improve product performance.",
    "engineer": "The research uncovers a critical flaw in LLM evaluations: a True Positive Rate of 96% contrasted with a True Negative Rate below 25%. The proposed minority-veto strategy and a regression-based framework show promise, with the latter achieving a 1.2% maximum absolute error in code feedback tasks, doubling the performance of a 14-model ensemble. This highlights the need for better evaluation techniques in AI development."
