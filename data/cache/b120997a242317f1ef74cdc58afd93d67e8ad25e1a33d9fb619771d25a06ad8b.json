  "raw_body": "Presented by Axis Communications \n\nMany businesses are equipped with a network of intelligent eyes that span operations. These IP cameras and intelligent edge devices were once solely focused on ensuring the safety of employees, customers, and inventory. These technologies have long proved to be essential tools for businesses, and while this sentiment still rings true, they’re now emerging as powerful resources.\nThese cameras and edge devices have rapidly evolved into real-time data producers. IP cameras can now see and understand, and the accompanying artificial intelligence helps companies and decision-makers generate business intelligence, improve operational efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage.\nBy treating cameras as vision sensors and sources of operational insight, businesses can transform everyday visibility into measurable business value.\nIntelligence on the edge\nNetwork cameras have come a long way since Axis Communications first introduced this technology in 1996. Over time, innovations like the ARTPEC chip, the first chip purpose-built for IP video, helped enhance image quality, analytics, and encoding performance.\nToday, these intelligent devices are powering a new generation of business intelligence and operational efficiency solutions via embedded AI. Actionable insights are now fed directly into intelligence platforms, ERP systems, and real-time dashboards, and the results are significant and far-reaching.\nIn manufacturing, intelligent cameras are detecting defects on the production line early, before an entire production run is compromised. In retail, these cameras can run software that maps customer journeys and optimizes product placement. In healthcare, these solutions help facilities enhance patient care while improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.\nThe combination of video and artificial intelligence has significantly expanded what cameras can do —  transforming them into vital tools for improving business performance.\nProof in practice\nCompanies are creatively taking advantage of edge devices like AI-enabled cameras to improve business intelligence and operational efficiencies. \nBMW has relied on intelligent IP cameras to optimize efficiency and product quality, with AI-driven video systems catching defects that are often invisible to the human eye. Or take Google Cloud’s shelf-checking AI technology, an innovative software that allows retailers to make instant restocking decisions using real-time data. \nThese technologies appeal to far more than retailers and vendors. The A.C. Camargo Cancer Center in Brazil uses network cameras to reduce theft, assure visitor and employee safety, and optimize patient flow. By relying on newfound business intelligence, the facility has saved more than $2 million in operational costs through two years, with those savings being reinvested directly into patient care. \nUrban projects can also benefit from edge devices and artificial intelligence. For example, Vanderbilt University turned to video analytics to study traffic flow, relying on AI to uncover the causes of phantom congestion and enabling smarter traffic management. These studies will have additional impact on the local environment and public, as the learnings can be used to optimize safety, air quality, and fuel efficiency. \nEach case illustrates the same point: AI-powered cameras can fuel a tangible return on investment and crucial business intelligence, regardless of the industry.\nPreparing for the next phase\nThe role of AI in video intelligence is still expanding, with several emerging trends driving greater advancements and impact in the years ahead:\n\nPredictive operations: cameras that are capable of forecasting needs or risks through predictive analytics\n\nVersatile analytics: systems that incorporate audio, thermal, and environmental sensors for more comprehensive and accurate insights\n\nTechnological collaboration: cameras that integrate with other intelligent edge devices to autonomously manage tasks\n\nSustainability initiatives: intelligent technologies that reduce energy use and support resource efficiency\n\nAxis Communications helps advance these possibilities with open-source, scalable systems engineered to address both today’s challenges and tomorrow’s opportunities. By staying ahead of this ever-changing environment, Axis helps ensure that organizations continue to benefit from actionable business intelligence while maintaining the highest standards of security and safety.\nCameras have evolved beyond simple surveillance tools. They are strategic assets that inform operations, foster innovation, and enable future readiness. Business leaders who cling to traditional views of IP cameras and edge devices risk missing opportunities for efficiency and innovation. Those who embrace an AI-driven approach can expect not only stronger security but also better business outcomes.\nUltimately, the value of IP cameras and edge devices lies not in categories but in capabilities. In an era of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, these unique technologies will become indispensable to overall business success.\n\nAbout Axis Communications\nAxis enables a smarter and safer world by improving security, safety, operational efficiency, and business intelligence.
