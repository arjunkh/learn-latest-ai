  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.13704v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The performance of production machine learning systems is fundamentally limited by the quality of their training data. In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.",

  "speedrun": "A new system called Adjudicator has been developed to tackle the issue of noisy labels in machine learning, which can hurt performance and trust in high-stakes applications. It uses a dynamic Knowledge Graph to guide a multi-agent architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs) that debate and vote on label validity. Adjudicator achieved a remarkable 0.99 F1-score on a benchmark dataset, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This advancement is crucial as it helps ensure high-quality training data in critical industrial settings.",

    "eli12": "Adjudicator is like a team of experts discussing the best answer to a tricky question. It uses a knowledge base to help these experts make better decisions about data labels. This matters because better data leads to more reliable technology that affects everyday services we use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Adjudicator highlights the importance of data quality in user trust and product performance. By utilizing a multi-agent system, it could reduce costs related to data correction and improve efficiency in training models. This means products could be launched faster with greater reliability.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Adjudicator employs a neuro-symbolic approach with a Knowledge Graph to enhance label verification. It achieved a 0.99 F1-score, outperforming single LLM models and non-KG councils significantly. This showcases the potential of combining structured knowledge with advanced language models for high-precision tasks."
