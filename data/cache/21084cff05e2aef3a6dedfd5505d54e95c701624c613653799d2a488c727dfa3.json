    "eli12": "Many Americans eat poorly, which is hurting their health. Think of diet like fuel for a car; if you use the wrong kind, the car won’t run well. Improving what we eat could help people feel better and live longer. This matters because better diets could lead to healthier lives for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this highlights a critical user need for healthier food options. There’s an opportunity to create products that cater to health-conscious consumers while addressing cost and efficiency. Developing solutions that promote better dietary habits could meet growing market demand.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, addressing dietary issues involves analyzing data on food consumption patterns and health outcomes. Models could show correlations between diet and diseases like diabetes, emphasizing the need for better nutritional education. However, implementing effective solutions may require overcoming significant systemic barriers."
