  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.10541v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Air pollution in cities and the possibilities of reducing this pollution represents one of the most important factors that today's society has to deal with. This paper focuses on a systemic approach to traffic emissions with their relation to meteorological conditions, analyzing the effect of weather on the quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in a city. Using fuzzy inference systems (FIS) the model for prediction of changes in emissions depending on various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic, meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with environmental protection in mind.",

  "speedrun": "A new study examines how weather affects traffic emissions in cities, using a model developed from data in Prague. It employs fuzzy inference systems to predict changes in emissions based on traffic and meteorological conditions. This research is crucial as urban planners and policymakers seek effective strategies to reduce air pollution while managing transportation. Understanding these dynamics could lead to cleaner air in urban environments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "City residents could benefit from cleaner air and improved health as emissions are better managed with this new understanding.",
    "This research could signal a shift in urban planning strategies, emphasizing the integration of environmental considerations into transportation systems."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This study looks at how weather impacts traffic pollution in cities. Think of it like a weather forecast for car emissions. By understanding these connections, city planners can create cleaner environments for everyone. This matters because it could lead to healthier urban living spaces.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in transportation solutions. It suggests that integrating weather data could enhance user experience and reduce costs related to emissions. This could lead to innovative products that align with sustainability goals.",
    "engineer": "The study uses fuzzy inference systems to model traffic emissions in relation to weather conditions, based on data from Prague. By analyzing how factors like temperature and wind affect pollution dispersion, the model provides a nuanced understanding of urban emissions. Engineers could leverage this approach to develop more effective emission-reduction technologies."
