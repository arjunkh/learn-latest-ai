    "eli12": "Vision language models work like a smart assistant that can read and interpret both images and text together. Imagine having a tool that can quickly skim through thousands of documents and understand their content at once. This matters because it can help people save time and make better decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, adopting vision language models could address user needs for faster document processing. These models may reduce operational costs by automating tasks that typically require human effort. A practical implication is that businesses could enhance their efficiency and focus on higher-value activities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, vision language models leverage architectures that integrate visual and textual data, allowing for nuanced understanding of documents. They can process millions of documents with speed, which is crucial for applications in fields like legal or academic research. However, it's essential to ensure the models are trained on diverse datasets to avoid biases in interpretation."
