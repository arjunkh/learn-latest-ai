  "speedrun": "Plotly Dash has introduced a structured framework specifically designed for creating multi-page dashboards, making it easier for developers to manage complex data visualizations. This framework provides a more organized approach, allowing for better scalability in larger projects. With the growing demand for sophisticated dashboards, this update is timely for both new and experienced users. It simplifies the development process and enhances user experience.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can now build complex dashboards more efficiently, saving time and reducing frustration during the development process.",
    "This reflects a broader trend towards modular design in software development, allowing for easier updates and maintenance in data visualization tools."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Plotly Dash's new framework helps people create dashboards that can show lots of information across different pages without getting messy. Think of it like organizing a bookshelf by genre—easier to find what you need! This matters because it makes data insights accessible for everyone, not just tech experts.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this framework addresses user needs for intuitive and scalable dashboards. It could reduce development costs and increase efficiency by allowing teams to focus on design rather than structure. A practical implication is that it enables faster iteration on user feedback.",
    "engineer": "The new multi-page framework in Plotly Dash streamlines the development of complex dashboards, enabling better organization of components. It supports modular code, which can simplify maintenance and scaling. This approach could lead to improved performance in data-heavy applications, although developers should still consider best practices for optimization."
