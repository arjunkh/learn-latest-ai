  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.23932v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed McCoy, a new framework that blends Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to enhance disease diagnosis. This approach translates medical literature into code, allowing for better integration with patient data. Early results indicate that McCoy performs well on small-scale diagnosis tasks, which could lead to more accurate and interpretable medical predictions. This is significant as it addresses the challenges of building reliable knowledge bases in healthcare.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Healthcare professionals could benefit from improved diagnostic tools, leading to faster and more accurate patient care.",
    "This framework represents a shift towards combining AI and traditional programming, potentially transforming how medical knowledge is applied in practice."

    "eli12": "McCoy is like a translator that turns complex medical documents into a language a computer can understand. By combining powerful AI with logical programming, it helps doctors make better diagnoses. This matters because improved disease prediction could save lives and enhance patient treatment.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, McCoy could streamline the way healthcare applications utilize AI for diagnosis. It addresses the user need for accurate predictions while potentially lowering costs associated with knowledge base construction. The practical implication is that healthcare apps could become more effective and user-friendly.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, McCoy utilizes LLMs to convert medical literature into Answer Set Programming code, which is then processed by an ASP solver. Preliminary results show strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks, indicating that this hybrid approach could effectively bridge the gap between AI and traditional programming methods in healthcare."
