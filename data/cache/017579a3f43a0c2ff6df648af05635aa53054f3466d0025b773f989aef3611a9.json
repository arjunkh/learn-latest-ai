    "eli12": "Imagine having a library where some books are hidden because they contain controversial ideas. The new DeepSeek R1 Slim is like that library, now fully open and 55% smaller, making it easier to navigate. This matters because it allows more people to access diverse ideas and knowledge without restrictions.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, DeepSeek R1 Slim presents an opportunity to leverage a more accessible AI model that can be integrated into various products. The reduction in size could lead to lower costs and improved efficiency in deployment. This means teams could innovate faster while ensuring their products are more open and versatile.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, DeepSeek R1 Slim is a streamlined version of the original model, boasting a 55% reduction in size while eliminating built-in censorship. This could enhance processing speed and efficiency, allowing developers to implement it in real-time applications. However, the specifics of its performance metrics compared to the original model were not detailed."
