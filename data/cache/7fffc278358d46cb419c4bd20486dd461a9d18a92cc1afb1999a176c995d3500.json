  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00021v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a physical theory of intelligence grounded in irreversible information processing in systems constrained by conservation laws. An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.",

  "speedrun": "A new theory of intelligence has been proposed, focusing on how information processing relates to physical laws. This theory introduces the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, which connects information to physical states by modeling intelligent systems as coupled agent-environment processes. It defines intelligence as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of processed information. This matters now as it could reshape our understanding of both biological and artificial intelligence.",

    "This could impact researchers in AI and neuroscience by providing a new lens to study intelligence and its efficiency mechanisms.",
    "It may influence the AI market by shifting how we design systems to optimize for efficiency and safety based on physical principles."

    "eli12": "This new theory suggests that intelligence can be understood through how information is processed physically. Think of it like a machine that not only uses data but also transforms it into meaningful actions. This matters because it could help us create smarter technologies that work better with the natural laws of our world.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this theory highlights the importance of designing systems that efficiently process information to achieve specific goals. By understanding the relationship between information and physical work, they could create products that are not only more effective but also safer. This insight could lead to innovations that better align with user needs and operational efficiency.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this theory introduces the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, which connects information processing to physical states through conservation laws. It suggests that efficient intelligent systems must maintain their internal informational structure while performing irreversible computations. This framework could guide engineers in developing AI systems that optimize information flow and work extraction, enhancing both performance and safety."
