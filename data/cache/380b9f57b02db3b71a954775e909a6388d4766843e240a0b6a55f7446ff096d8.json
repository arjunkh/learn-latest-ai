  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00003v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically enhance their performance through either the retrieval of semantically similar information or the improvement of their reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new method for large language models (LLMs) that combines knowledge retrieval with reasoning. By using a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired approach, this method enhances the relevance of information retrieved during conversations. In tests on multi-turn dialogue datasets, it showed improved alignment with human reasoning and increased diversity in responses. This development could lead to more engaging and informative AI interactions in various applications.",

    "eli12": "This research shows how AI can be smarter in conversations by finding the right information and using it effectively. Think of it as a librarian who not only knows where books are but also understands what you need for your specific question. This matters because it could make AI assistants more helpful in everyday tasks, like answering questions or providing advice.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this new retrieval method could significantly enhance user engagement by providing more contextually relevant responses. It addresses the need for AI that not only retrieves information but also understands the reasoning behind user queries. This could lead to more efficient interactions, ultimately improving user satisfaction and retention.",
    "engineer": "The paper presents a novel approach that integrates reasoning with knowledge retrieval in LLMs using a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired method. By first narrowing down to a relevant sub-region of the knowledge base and then refining the search for reasoning-specific information, the model demonstrates improved performance on multi-turn dialogue datasets. This dual-phase strategy enhances the diversity and relevance of responses, marking a potential advancement in how LLMs handle complex conversational tasks."
