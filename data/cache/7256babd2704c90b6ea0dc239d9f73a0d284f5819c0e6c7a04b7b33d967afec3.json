  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.15143v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research explores ways to protect large language models (LLMs) from unauthorized knowledge distillation, a method where capabilities are transferred to smaller models. The study introduces techniques like anti-distillation, which reduces the usefulness of responses for unauthorized users, and API watermarking, embedding signatures for verification. These methods maintain the accuracy of the original model while deterring misuse. This is crucial now as the demand for efficient AI solutions rises, making protection against exploitation more urgent.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers of LLMs could see immediate benefits, as these techniques may help safeguard their investments and intellectual property.",
    "On a broader scale, these advancements could shift the landscape of AI development, emphasizing the importance of security in model training and deployment."

    "eli12": "Imagine a teacher who wants to share their knowledge but worries that students might cheat by copying their notes. This research offers ways to protect the teacher's insights while still helping students learn. By making it harder for others to misuse their work, it ensures that creators are recognized and rewarded, which benefits everyone in the long run.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a growing user need for secure AI models that protect proprietary information. Implementing these techniques could enhance the efficiency of smaller models while ensuring that the original model's value isn't compromised. This could lead to more trust from users, potentially increasing market share.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the study introduces methods like anti-distillation and API watermarking to protect LLMs. It demonstrates that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach can effectively degrade the training utility of unauthorized queries while preserving the teacher model's performance. This dual capability ensures both security and functionality, which is essential for future AI applications."
