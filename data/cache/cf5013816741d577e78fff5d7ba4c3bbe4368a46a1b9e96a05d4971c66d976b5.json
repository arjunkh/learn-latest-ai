  "speedrun": "The article discusses the evolution of Web 3.0, highlighting its goal of a user-controlled internet without intermediaries. It contrasts this with Web 2.0's reliance on centralized systems. The hybrid approach of combining elements from both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 is suggested as a way to enhance user experience and data management. This matters now as the integration of AI with Web 3.0 could reshape how we interact online.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Users could gain more control over their data, leading to enhanced privacy and security in online interactions.",
    "The blending of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 could signify a shift in how businesses operate, focusing on user empowerment and decentralized solutions."

    "eli12": "Web 3.0 aims to give users more control over their online experience. Imagine a library where you can borrow books without a librarian—no one controlling what you can read. This shift is important for everyday people as it could lead to a safer and more personalized internet.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the hybrid approach means understanding user needs for control and privacy. Balancing efficiency with a decentralized model could lower costs and improve user satisfaction. This could lead to innovative products that attract a more engaged user base.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the hybrid model leverages both decentralized and centralized systems to optimize data flow and user experience. By integrating AI with Web 3.0, developers can create smarter applications that adapt to user behavior. However, achieving this balance requires careful consideration of security and scalability."
