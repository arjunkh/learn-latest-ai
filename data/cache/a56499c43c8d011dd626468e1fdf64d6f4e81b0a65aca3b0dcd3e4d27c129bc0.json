    "eli12": "The Jacobian adjustment is like making sure a recipe stays balanced when you change the serving size. If you double the ingredients, you need to adjust cooking times too. This concept matters because when we transform data in everyday tasks, like predicting trends, we want to ensure our results are trustworthy.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the Jacobian adjustment can enhance data-driven decision-making. It highlights the importance of accurate probability transformations when analyzing user behavior, which could lead to better product features. This knowledge can help in optimizing resources and improving user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the Jacobian adjustment involves calculating the determinant of the Jacobian matrix during variable transformations. This ensures that the probability density functions remain valid. It’s crucial for maintaining the integrity of models, especially when working with complex distributions or high-dimensional data."
