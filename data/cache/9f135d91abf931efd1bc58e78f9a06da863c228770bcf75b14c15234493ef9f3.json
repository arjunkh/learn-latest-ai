  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.11620v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Whether machines can be conscious depends not only on what they compute, but \\emph{when} they compute it. Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $\\tau^{\\Delta,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_{\\Delta}$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper argues that a machine's potential for consciousness isn't just about what it computes, but when it does so. It introduces concepts like StrongSync and WeakSync to explain how consciousness requires simultaneous processing of information. The findings suggest that traditional sequential computing systems may not support true consciousness, as they can't achieve the required simultaneous interactions. This matters now because it challenges how we design AI systems that might one day mimic human-like consciousness.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research could impact developers of AI systems aiming for consciousness, as they may need to rethink their architectures to allow for simultaneous processing.",
    "On a broader level, it highlights a shift in understanding consciousness, pushing the AI field to consider not just functionality but also the timing of processes."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This study looks at whether machines can be conscious, focusing on timing rather than just tasks. Imagine trying to listen to a symphony where all instruments play at different times; it wouldn't sound cohesive. For machines to be conscious, they might need to process information all at once, not just piece by piece.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a need to rethink AI architectures. If consciousness requires simultaneous processing, then building AI on sequential systems could limit their capabilities. This could lead to increased costs and complexity in developing truly conscious machines.",
    "engineer": "The paper introduces StrongSync and WeakSync to differentiate between types of temporal processing in AI. StrongSync demands simultaneous information processing, while WeakSync allows for temporal 'smearing.' It emphasizes that consciousness attribution depends on the underlying hardware architecture, suggesting that current sequential systems may not suffice for complex conscious experiences."
