    "eli12": "Imagine having a smart assistant that helps you build things faster and fixes problems without you lifting a finger. That's what Codex does for engineers, making their work smoother and more efficient. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to faster software updates and better technology in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Codex represents a new way to meet user needs by automating tedious tasks in software development. This could reduce costs and improve efficiency, allowing teams to focus on innovation. A practical implication is that companies could launch products more quickly and with fewer errors.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Codex utilizes advanced AI models to integrate seamlessly into engineering workflows. It automates defect fixes and accelerates builds, which could lead to faster deployment cycles. However, the article does not detail specific benchmarks or performance metrics, so further analysis would be necessary to gauge its full impact."
