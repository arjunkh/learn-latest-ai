    "eli12": "Using AI agents for searching through large documents is like having a super-smart librarian who knows exactly where to find the information you need. This technology helps people quickly access relevant data, making their work easier and more efficient. For everyday users, this means less time searching and more time focusing on important tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, employing AI agents for information retrieval could significantly enhance user experience by providing faster and more accurate results. This approach not only meets user needs for quick access to information but also optimizes operational efficiency. A practical implication is that teams could allocate resources more effectively, focusing on strategic initiatives rather than manual data searches.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, using AI agents for information retrieval involves models that can comprehend context and semantics within documents. These agents utilize natural language processing techniques to improve search accuracy and relevance. While the article doesn't highlight specific benchmarks, the implication is that these models could outperform traditional search methods, making them a valuable tool in data-heavy environments."
