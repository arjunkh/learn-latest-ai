    "eli12": "Building RAG systems is like setting up a library where every book is perfectly organized and easy to find. The lessons learned highlight how important it is to have good data and smart retrieval designs. This matters to everyday people because better information retrieval can lead to faster and more accurate answers to their questions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, these lessons suggest that focusing on data quality and retrieval design can enhance user satisfaction. Improved efficiency in accessing information could reduce costs and increase the value provided to users. Practically, this means investing in better data management practices to meet user needs effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article stresses the importance of using high-quality datasets and designing efficient retrieval mechanisms in RAG systems. These factors can dramatically influence the performance and accuracy of the output. Engineers should keep in mind that the choice of data and retrieval strategies can directly affect system reliability."
