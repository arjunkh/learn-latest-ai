  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.05998v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored whether framing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) as a betting game could enhance prediction accuracy and reveal confidence levels. By using a fictional currency called LLMCoin, the study found that models made more accurate predictions (81.5% vs. 79.1%) and learned faster when incentivized to wager. This approach highlights the potential for financial framing to improve how LLMs communicate their confidence, which could influence future model evaluations and applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could help developers and researchers better understand LLM performance, leading to more informed decisions in AI development.",
    "The findings suggest a shift towards using financial incentives in AI evaluations, which could reshape how models are assessed and improved in the industry."

    "eli12": "This study looked at whether treating LLM evaluations like a betting game could help models predict better and show how confident they are. By using LLMCoin, models that made bigger bets performed almost perfectly, while smaller bets had less accuracy. This matters because it could help people trust AI predictions more, making them more useful in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this study indicates that creating incentives for LLMs could enhance user trust in AI predictions. By understanding how to frame evaluations, they might improve model performance and user satisfaction. Implementing this betting mechanic could also streamline decision-making processes, making AI tools more efficient.",
    "engineer": "The study tested six baseline models and three predictor models, revealing that models using an incentive system showed a modest accuracy increase (81.5% vs. 79.1%) and improved learning rates. Notably, larger bets correlated with higher accuracy, suggesting that a financial framing could help LLMs provide clearer confidence signals. This approach opens pathways for future meta-evaluation systems in AI."
