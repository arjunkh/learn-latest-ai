  "speedrun": "The article explores how the role of data scientists has evolved across three generations of machine learning: Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights that each phase has its own strengths and optimal use cases. For instance, while traditional methods excel in structured data, LLMs shine in handling unstructured text. Understanding these distinctions is crucial as businesses increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data scientists can better choose the right tools for their projects, improving efficiency and outcomes in their work.",
    "This evolution reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where businesses are shifting towards more sophisticated AI solutions to tackle complex problems."

    "eli12": "The article breaks down how data science has changed over time. Think of it like upgrading from a bicycle to a car and then to a spaceship. Each mode helps you travel differently and faster. This matters because understanding these tools can help people make better choices in their daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, recognizing when to use traditional machine learning versus LLMs can streamline product development. This could lead to reduced costs and improved user experiences. Knowing the right approach allows for more efficient resource allocation and targeted solutions.",
    "engineer": "The article outlines the technical evolution from traditional algorithms to complex LLMs. Traditional methods often handle structured data well, while LLMs, like GPT-3, excel with unstructured text, offering flexibility in applications. Understanding these models helps engineers optimize performance based on the data type."
