    "eli12": "Rackspace points out that many companies hit roadblocks with AI because of messy data and unclear rules about who owns it. Imagine trying to bake a cake without a clear recipe or knowing who brought the ingredients; it just doesn't work well. These insights matter because they help everyday people understand why some AI projects fail and what needs fixing.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Rackspace's insights reveal the importance of establishing clear data governance and ownership in AI projects. Addressing these issues could lead to more efficient operations and lower costs. A practical step would be to implement a framework for data management, which can streamline AI model deployment.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Rackspace's discussion emphasizes the need for robust data governance and management practices in AI. They highlight that messy data can lead to inefficiencies, especially when models are in production. Engineers should consider building systems that ensure data quality and clarify ownership to optimize AI performance."
