    "eli12": "OpenAI is making ChatGPT cheaper for more people, which could help those who need AI support but can't afford it. Think of it like a library that offers free books but charges for special events. This matters because it opens doors for more users to benefit from AI technology in their daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this change highlights a growing need to balance affordability with quality. Offering a cheaper tier could attract a larger user base, while premium options maintain revenue. This could lead to new features that cater to both segments, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, expanding the ChatGPT tier may require optimizing existing models to handle increased user volume efficiently. OpenAI could implement strategies like load balancing or model distillation to ensure performance remains high. This approach could set new benchmarks for cost-effectiveness in AI deployment."
