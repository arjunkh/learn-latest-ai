  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.10767v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research has introduced new ways to encode argumentation properties using a graph measure called clique-width. This is significant because clique-width can be small even for dense graphs, unlike treewidth. The study presents reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT, maintaining the clique-width in the process. This work is crucial as it enhances our understanding of computational properties in argumentation, which could lead to more efficient algorithms in the future.",

    "eli12": "This study explores how to better represent arguments in a way that computers can understand. Think of it like finding a clearer map for navigating a complex city. By improving how we encode these arguments, we could make AI systems smarter and more efficient in resolving conflicts, which matters for everything from chatbots to automated decision-making.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a way to enhance AI reasoning capabilities. By understanding clique-width, teams could develop more efficient algorithms that save time and resources. This could lead to better products that handle complex decision-making tasks, appealing to users who need reliable AI solutions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study introduces directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions that maintain clique-width while transitioning argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. This approach is significant as it preserves computational efficiency, especially in dense graphs. The findings suggest that while DDG reductions improve encoding, their overhead cannot be significantly minimized, indicating a fundamental limitation in current techniques."
