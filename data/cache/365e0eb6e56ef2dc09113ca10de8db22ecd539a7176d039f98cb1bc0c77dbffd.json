  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.17643v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the pix2pix model, can autonomously learn spatial topological relationships in architectural design. By introducing Grasshopper-based detection modules, researchers demonstrated that pix2pix can effectively recognize these relationships while minimizing information loss during data conversion. This research is significant as it could streamline architectural design processes, allowing for more efficient urban renewal projects that maintain the integrity of spatial characteristics.",

    "Architects and urban planners could benefit from improved tools that enhance design accuracy and efficiency, making it easier to incorporate local spatial characteristics.",
    "This research signals a shift towards more automated design processes in architecture, potentially transforming how urban environments are conceptualized and developed."

    "eli12": "This study shows that AI can help architects understand how spaces relate to each other, much like how a map helps you navigate a city. By using a specific type of AI called pix2pix, designers can create better buildings that fit their surroundings. This matters because it could lead to more thoughtful and cohesive urban designs that respect local characteristics.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a growing user need for tools that simplify architectural design. By leveraging the capabilities of pix2pix, businesses could reduce costs associated with data conversion and improve design efficiency. A practical implication is the potential for new software solutions that integrate these detection modules for faster project turnaround.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces a method to enhance the pix2pix GAN's ability to learn spatial topological relationships through two Grasshopper-based detection modules. It demonstrates that these modules can quickly assess learning efficiency across different input types, such as greyscale and RGB images. This approach not only fills a gap in topological performance detection but also offers a streamlined process that could be integrated into existing architectural workflows."
