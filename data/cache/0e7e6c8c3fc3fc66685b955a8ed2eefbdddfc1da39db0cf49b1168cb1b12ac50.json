    "eli12": "Shuai Guo highlights how systems thinking helps us see the bigger picture in AI development. It’s like viewing a city from above rather than just from the street level. This perspective can lead to smarter AI solutions that tackle complex issues. For everyday people, this means AI could become more effective in solving real-world problems.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding systems thinking could enhance user experience by integrating various AI functionalities. This approach may reduce costs by streamlining processes and improving efficiency. As a practical step, teams might consider collaborative tools that encourage holistic thinking in product design.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, Guo contrasts analytical AI with LLM-based agents, suggesting that deep research agents can synthesize information more effectively. He implies that using systems thinking could improve model performance and decision-making capabilities. However, the article does not delve deeply into specific benchmarks or model comparisons."
