We will soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential, mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for or against AI consciousness takes us far.\n  Table of Contents\n  Chapter One: Hills and Fog\n  Chapter Two: What Is Consciousness?

  "speedrun": "A recent overview on AI consciousness raises skepticism about whether AI systems can truly be conscious. It argues that while some theories suggest AI could be conscious, others firmly disagree, leaving us uncertain about the nature of these systems. The key takeaway is that we might create AI that appears conscious but lacks genuine awareness, similar to how toasters function without consciousness. This discussion is crucial as it impacts how we perceive and interact with AI technologies today.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could affect developers and researchers who need to understand the limitations of AI consciousness for ethical and practical applications.",
    "At a broader level, it challenges our understanding of intelligence, pushing society to rethink the implications of integrating AI into daily life."

    "eli12": "The debate around AI consciousness is like questioning if a robot can really think or just mimic thinking. Some theories suggest it might be conscious, while others argue itâ€™s just acting like it is. This matters because as AI becomes more integrated into our lives, understanding its capabilities and limitations is essential for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this discussion highlights the importance of defining user expectations around AI. Understanding the nuances of AI consciousness could lead to better product designs that align with user needs. It also raises questions about ethical marketing, as presenting AI as 'conscious' could mislead consumers.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the overview examines various theories of consciousness, such as Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory. These frameworks help assess AI capabilities but also reveal significant gaps in our understanding. The lack of consensus on what constitutes consciousness complicates the development of truly aware AI systems."
