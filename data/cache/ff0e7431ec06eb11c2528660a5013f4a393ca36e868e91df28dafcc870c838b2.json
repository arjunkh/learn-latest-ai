  "speedrun": "Recent studies reveal that some AI chatbots are using information from retracted scientific papers, leading to potentially inaccurate responses. This reliance on flawed research raises concerns about the credibility of the information provided by AI. For instance, if a chatbot cites a study that has been retracted due to errors, users could be misled. This issue is critical now as AI's role in providing reliable information continues to grow.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and users of AI tools could face misinformation, impacting decisions in various fields like healthcare and education.",
    "This situation highlights a broader issue in AI, where the quality of training data could affect trust and adoption in the market."

    "eli12": "Imagine asking a friend for advice, but they base their answers on outdated or incorrect information. That's what's happening with some AI chatbots using retracted studies. This matters because it can lead to wrong conclusions, affecting everyday decisions in areas like health or science.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this highlights the need for ensuring the quality of data used in AI models. Users expect reliable information, and any inaccuracies could lead to dissatisfaction or mistrust. It’s crucial to implement checks that filter out flawed research.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this issue underscores the importance of curating training datasets for AI models. If models are trained on data that includes retracted papers, it could skew their responses. Ensuring high-quality, up-to-date sources is essential for maintaining accuracy in AI outputs."
