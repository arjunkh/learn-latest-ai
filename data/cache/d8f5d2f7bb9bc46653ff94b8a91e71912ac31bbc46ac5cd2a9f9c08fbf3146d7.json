    "eli12": "Think of Piclabs AI like a magic paintbrush that lets anyone create beautiful ads without needing to learn how to paint. This helps small business owners but may hurt professional designers. But watch out for the risk of generic ads flooding the market. Young people should care because it opens new opportunities for entrepreneurship in the digital age.",
    "pm": "A specific use case could be a local caf√© using Piclabs AI to create social media ads quickly. This gives them a competitive edge over other small businesses that may not have access to such technology. However, reliance on AI-generated content could lead to a lack of unique brand identity. A PM should consider integrating user feedback mechanisms to refine ad quality.",
    "engineer": "The technical approach involves AI algorithms to generate ads based on user inputs, though specific algorithms or frameworks are not mentioned. A key limitation is the potential lack of personalization in the ads generated. Compared to traditional design software, which offers extensive customization, this tool may fall short in delivering tailored solutions. A red flag is the absence of details on how the AI ensures quality and relevance in the generated content."
