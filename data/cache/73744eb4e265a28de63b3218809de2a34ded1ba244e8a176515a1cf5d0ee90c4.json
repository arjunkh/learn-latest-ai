  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.18897v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.",

    "eli12": "This research focuses on improving how we predict energy needs in wastewater treatment plants. By using a system that explains uncertainty, operators can make smarter decisions. Think of it like having a weather forecast that not only tells you if it will rain but also how confident the prediction is. This matters because better predictions can lead to lower energy bills and a greener environment.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this study highlights the importance of transparency in AI models. Users in the wastewater sector need reliable energy forecasts to optimize operations. The IT2-ANFIS model could reduce costs by minimizing energy waste, and its explainability can enhance user trust. This could lead to better adoption of AI solutions in critical infrastructure.",
    "engineer": "The IT2-ANFIS model offers a structured approach to uncertainty quantification in energy predictions. It decomposes uncertainty into three levels: feature, rule, and instance, which enhances interpretability compared to traditional methods. Validated on Melbourne Water's dataset, it shows similar predictive performance to first-order ANFIS but with reduced variance. This model could be a significant step in making machine learning applications more reliable in safety-critical environments."
