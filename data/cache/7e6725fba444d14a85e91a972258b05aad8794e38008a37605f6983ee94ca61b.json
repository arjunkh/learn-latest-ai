    "eli12": "Agentic AI is like a smart assistant that can make decisions on its own, promising significant economic benefits. However, only a tiny fraction of businesses are using it effectively. This matters because if more companies adopt it, we could see improved efficiency and new opportunities for growth in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, agentic AI presents a unique opportunity to meet user needs with advanced, autonomous features. However, the low adoption rate indicates a potential risk in investing heavily in this technology.

Despite its promise, only 2% of organizations have implemented it at scale, suggesting challenges in integration and understanding. Engineers should consider these factors when developing or adopting new AI solutions."
