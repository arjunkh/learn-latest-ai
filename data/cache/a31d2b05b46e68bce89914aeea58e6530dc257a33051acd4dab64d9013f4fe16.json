  "speedrun": "A new tutorial on building a neural network classifier in Excel was released as part of the Machine Learning Advent Calendar. It focuses on explaining forward propagation and backpropagation using clear formulas. This hands-on approach allows users to grasp complex concepts without needing advanced programming skills. Understanding these processes is crucial for anyone interested in machine learning, as they form the backbone of how neural networks learn from data.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This resource is particularly beneficial for students and professionals who want to learn machine learning without diving into code.",
    "It reflects a growing trend of making complex AI concepts accessible, potentially expanding the talent pool in the field."

    "eli12": "This tutorial simplifies how neural networks work by breaking down processes like forward and backward propagation. Think of it like teaching a child to walk: they first move forward, then learn to correct their steps. By using Excel, more people can experiment with these ideas, making machine learning more relatable and easier to understand.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a user-friendly approach to machine learning education. It addresses the need for accessible resources that demystify AI concepts, potentially reducing training costs and accelerating team onboarding. This could lead to more innovative applications as a wider audience becomes familiar with machine learning principles.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the tutorial emphasizes the mathematical foundations of forward and backpropagation through explicit formulas. It illustrates how these processes adjust weights in a neural network, crucial for improving model accuracy. While it simplifies the concepts, engineers should note that practical implementations often require deeper understanding and coding expertise."
