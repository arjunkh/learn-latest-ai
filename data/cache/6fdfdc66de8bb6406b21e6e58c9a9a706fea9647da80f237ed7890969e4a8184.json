  "raw_body": "Presented by Certinia\n\nThe initial euphoria around Generative and Agentic AI has shifted to a pragmatic, often frustrated, reality. CIOs and technical leaders are asking why their pilot programs, even those designed to automate the simplest of workflows, aren’t delivering the magic promised in demos.\nWhen AI fails to answer a basic question or complete an action correctly, the instinct is to blame the model. We assume the LLM isn’t \"smart\" enough. But that blame is misplaced. AI doesn’t struggle because it lacks intelligence. It struggles because it lacks context.\nIn the modern enterprise, context is trapped in a maze of disconnected point solutions, brittle APIs, and latency-ridden integrations — a “Franken-stack” of disparate technologies. And for services-centric organizations in particular, where the real truth of the business lives in the handoffs between sales, delivery, success, and finance, this fragmentation is existential. If your architecture walls off these functions, your AI roadmap is destined for failure.\nContext can’t travel through an API\nFor the last decade, the standard IT strategy was \"best-of-breed.\" You bought the best CRM for sales, a separate tool for managing projects, a standalone CSP for success, and an ERP for finance; stitched them together with APIs and middleware (if you were lucky), and declared victory.\nFor human workers, this was annoying but manageable. A human knows that the project status in the project management tool might be 72 hours behind the invoice data in the ERP. Humans possess the intuition to bridge the gap between systems.\nBut AI doesn’t have intuition. It has queries. When you ask an AI agent to “staff this new project we won for margin and utilization impact,\" it executes a query based on the data it can access now. If your architecture relies on integrations to move data, the AI is working with a delay. It sees the signed contract, but not the resource shortage. It sees the revenue target, but not the churn risk.\nThe result is not only a wrong answer, but a confident, plausible-sounding wrong answer based on partial truths. Acting on that creates costly operational pitfalls that go far beyond failed AI pilots alone.\nWhy agentic AI requires a platform-native architecture\nThis is why the conversation is shifting from \"which model should we use?\" to \"where does our data live?\"\nTo support a hybrid workforce where human experts work alongside duly capable AI agents, the underlying data can’t be stitched together; it must be native to the core business platform. A platform-native approach, specifically one built on a common data model (e.g. Salesforce), eliminates the translation layer and provides the single source of truth that good, reliable AI requires.\nIn a native environment, data lives in a single object model. A scope change in delivery is a revenue change in finance. There is no sync, no latency, and no loss of state.\nThis is the only way to achieve real certainty with AI. If you want an agent to autonomously staff a project or forecast revenue, it’s going to require a 360-degree view of the truth, not a series of snapshots taped together by middleware.\nThe security tax of the side door: APIs as attack surface\nOnce you solve for intelligence, you must solve for sovereignty. The argument for a unified platform is usually framed around efficiency, but an increasingly pressing argument is security.\nIn a best-of-breed Franken-stack, every API connection you build is effectively a new door you have to lock. When you rely on third-party point solutions for critical functions like customer success or resource management, you’re constantly piping sensitive customer data out of your core system of record and into satellite apps. This movement is the risk.\nWe’ve seen this play out in recent high-profile supply chain breaches. Hackers didn't need to storm the castle gates of the core platform. They simply walked in through the side door by exploiting the persistent authentication tokens of connected third-party apps.\nA platform-native strategy solves this through security by inheritance. When your data stays resident on a single platform, it inherits the massive security investment and trust boundary of that platform. You aren't moving data across the wire to a different vendor’s cloud just to analyze it. The gold never leaves the vault.\nFix the architecture, then curate the context\nThe pressure to deploy AI is immense, but layering intelligent agents on top of unintelligent architecture is a waste of time and resources.\nLeaders often hesitate because they fear their data isn't \"clean enough.\" They believe they have to scrub every record from the last ten years before they can deploy a single agent. On a fragmented stack, this fear is valid.\nA platform-native architecture changes the math. Because the data, metadata, and agents live in the same house, you don't need to boil the ocean. Simply ring-fence specific, trusted fields — like active customer contracts or current resource schedules — and tell the agent, 'Work here. Ignore the rest.' By eliminating the need for complex API translations and third-party middleware, a unified platform allows you to ground agents in your most reliable, connected data today, bypassing the mess without waiting for a 'perfect' state that may never arrive.\nWe often fear that AI will hallucinate because it’s too creative. The real danger is that it will fail because it’s blind. And you cannot automate a complex business with fragmented visibility. Deny your new agentic workforce access to the full context of your operations on a unified platform, and you’re building a foundation that is sure to fail.\n\nRaju Malhotra is  Chief Product & Technology Officer at Certinia.\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

  "speedrun": "The excitement around Generative and Agentic AI is fading as many pilot programs fail to deliver expected results. CIOs are realizing that AI struggles not due to a lack of intelligence but because it lacks context, often trapped in a complex web of disconnected systems, termed 'Franken-stacks.' This fragmentation leads to incorrect AI outputs based on incomplete data. Addressing this issue is crucial for organizations aiming to successfully integrate AI into their operations.",

    "eli12": "Many companies are excited about AI, but they're finding that it often fails to work as expected. This is because AI needs clear and complete information to function well. Think of it like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces; you can't see the full picture. For everyday people, understanding this could help them see why some AI tools might not be delivering the results they hoped for.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this highlights the importance of integrating data systems to support AI effectively. Users need reliable and timely information for AI to function correctly, which could improve efficiency. A practical implication is that investing in a unified platform could help avoid costly mistakes and enhance the overall user experience.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AI's performance is hindered by fragmented data architectures, often leading to inaccurate outputs. Current models depend on integrated systems to provide real-time context, yet many organizations still use outdated best-of-breed approaches. A shift towards platform-native architectures could streamline data access, reducing latency and improving AI reliability."
