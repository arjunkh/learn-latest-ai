  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.07040v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.\n  We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.\n  Aster is accessible via a web interface and API at asterlab.ai.",

    "eli12": "Aster is like a super-fast student who learns and improves on tasks much quicker than others. It takes an initial program, tweaks it, and often finds better solutions than before. This matters because it means researchers can discover new things faster, making science progress more quickly for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Aster represents a significant opportunity to enhance efficiency in research and development. By reducing the time and resources needed for complex tasks, teams could allocate more effort to innovation. This could lead to faster product iterations and more effective solutions in various industries.",
    "engineer": "Aster leverages advanced algorithms to optimize programs iteratively, achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like GPU kernel engineering and single-cell analysis. Notably, it matched human performance in ZAPBench while using less than 1/190th of the compute resources. This efficiency opens up new possibilities for tackling long-duration evaluations in machine learning and other fields."
