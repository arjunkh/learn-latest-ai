  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00814v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents our work on cross-lingual ontology alignment system which uses embedding based cosine similarity matching. The ontology entities are made contextually richer by creating descriptions using novel techniques. We use a fine-tuned transformer based multilingual model for generating better embeddings. We use cosine similarity to find positive ontology entities pairs and then apply threshold filtering to retain only highly similar entities. We have evaluated our work on OAEI-2022 multifarm track. We achieve 71% F1 score (78% recall and 65% precision) on the evaluation dataset, 16% increase from best baseline score. This suggests that our proposed alignment pipeline is able to capture the subtle cross-lingual similarities.",
