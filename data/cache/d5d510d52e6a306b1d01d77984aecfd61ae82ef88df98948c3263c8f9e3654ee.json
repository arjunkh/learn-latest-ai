  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.15948v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks, as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against complex cross-modal threats.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced VisuoAlign, a new framework aimed at improving the safety alignment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). This framework uses prompt-guided tree search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance safety during reasoning. In tests, VisuoAlign showed significant improvements in identifying risks and generating robust responses against complex threats. This development is crucial as it addresses vulnerabilities in existing LVLMs that could be exploited through multimodal inputs.",

    "eli12": "VisuoAlign is like giving a safety helmet to an athlete. It helps Large Vision-Language Models, which can see and understand text, to think safely while making decisions. By using smart prompts, it checks for risks before they happen. This is important for everyday people because it means safer interactions with AI tools in daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, VisuoAlign offers a way to enhance user safety in AI applications. By integrating safety checks into the reasoning process, it could reduce the potential for harmful outputs. This means that products using LVLMs could become more trustworthy, potentially leading to higher user adoption and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "VisuoAlign employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to create diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories, enhancing the robustness of LVLMs against cross-modal threats. Its prompt-based scaling ensures real-time risk detection, which is vital for maintaining safety in dynamic environments. This approach could set new benchmarks for safety alignment in multimodal AI systems."
