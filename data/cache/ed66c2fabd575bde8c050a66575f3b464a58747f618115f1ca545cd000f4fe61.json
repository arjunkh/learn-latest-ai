    "eli12": "Imagine if your smartphone could learn how you use it and adjust its settings automatically. That's what Memp's new 'procedural memory' does for AI agents. It helps them adapt to new tasks just like we do. This matters because it means smarter, more efficient technology that can help people in their daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Memp's 'procedural memory' offers a chance to meet user needs more effectively. By creating adaptable AI, teams can provide solutions that evolve with user requirements. A practical next step is to explore how this feature can enhance existing products or services.",
    "engineer": "Memp's approach focuses on instilling procedural memory in LLM agents, allowing them to learn from experiences. This can enhance task flexibility but may also introduce challenges in ensuring consistent performance. Comparing it to traditional static models, this method could lead to more dynamic and responsive AI systems."
