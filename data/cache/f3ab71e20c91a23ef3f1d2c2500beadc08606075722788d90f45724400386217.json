  "speedrun": "A recent article delves into statistical power analysis in marketing, explaining its importance in determining the sample size needed for reliable results. It outlines how power, typically expressed as a percentage, indicates the likelihood of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. For example, a power of 80% means there's an 80% chance of detecting an effect if it exists. This understanding is crucial for marketers to make informed decisions based on data.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Marketers can better allocate resources by ensuring their sample sizes are sufficient for reliable insights, reducing wasted efforts.",
    "As data-driven decision-making grows, understanding power analysis could become essential for competitive marketing strategies across industries."

    "eli12": "Statistical power is like having a strong flashlight in a dark room; it helps you see what’s really there. In marketing, knowing the power of your tests means you can trust the results you get from your surveys or experiments. This matters because it helps businesses make smarter choices based on solid evidence.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding power analysis means knowing how many users to include in tests to get reliable feedback. This can save time and money by preventing over-investment in untested ideas. A well-calibrated sample size can lead to more accurate insights, helping to refine product features effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, power analysis involves calculating the effect size, sample size, significance level, and desired power to determine the necessary sample for experiments. Using software tools, marketers can simulate different scenarios to find optimal sample sizes. However, assumptions about effect size and variability must be carefully considered, as they can significantly impact results."
