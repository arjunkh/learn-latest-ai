  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.04855v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.",

  "speedrun": "A new approach called epistemic reject-option prediction has been introduced to improve predictive models in uncertain situations. Unlike traditional methods that focus on aleatoric uncertainty, this model considers epistemic uncertainty, which arises from limited training data. It allows models to abstain from making predictions when uncertainty is high, potentially minimizing costly mistakes. This development is significant as it enhances decision-making in high-stakes applications, where accuracy and reliability are crucial.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could immediately benefit industries like healthcare or finance, where incorrect predictions can lead to serious consequences due to high uncertainty levels.",
    "On a broader scale, this approach could shift how predictive models are trained and evaluated, emphasizing the importance of understanding data limitations."

    "eli12": "This new model helps predictive systems know when to stay silent instead of guessing. Think of it like a doctor who decides not to make a diagnosis without enough information. This is important for everyone, as it could lead to better decisions in critical areas like healthcare and finance.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, this model highlights the need to address uncertainty in predictions. By allowing models to abstain from predictions when data is insufficient, it could improve user trust and reduce costly errors. This practical approach could enhance product reliability and user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The epistemic reject-option predictor builds on Bayesian learning to minimize expected regret, which is the gap between the model's performance and the ideal Bayes-optimal predictor. It specifically addresses high epistemic uncertainty due to limited data, allowing models to abstain when the rejection cost exceeds a certain threshold. This is a notable advancement in creating models that can better navigate uncertainty."
