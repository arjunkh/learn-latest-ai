  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.08847v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs, extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C# code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development, positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game design to implementation.",
