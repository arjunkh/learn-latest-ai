    "eli12": "New research shows that open-source AI models use a lot more computer power than closed ones. This is important because it means businesses might spend more money than they thought. It makes people think twice about using open-source AI.",
    "pm": "Businesses looking to implement AI will find this research critical, as it highlights the hidden costs of open-source models. By revealing the inefficiencies, companies can better assess their options, balancing cost against performance. This could lead to a preference for closed models, impacting market competition and innovation.",
    "engineer": "The study indicates that open-source AI models often require significantly more computational resources due to their architecture and optimization methods. This inefficiency can lead to increased latency and operational costs, which are critical for enterprises. Limitations include scalability issues and potential performance bottlenecks that may arise when deploying these models in production environments."
