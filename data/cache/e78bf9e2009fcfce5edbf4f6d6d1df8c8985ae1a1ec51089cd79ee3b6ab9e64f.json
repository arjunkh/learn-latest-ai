  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.14271v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper outlines the Ontological Neutrality Theorem, which argues that data systems need to support accountability amid differing legal and political views. The authors claim that neutrality cannot coexist with causal or normative commitments, meaning any shared ontology must avoid these elements entirely. This is crucial now as data systems increasingly face diverse interpretations and must remain stable across various frameworks.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This finding impacts developers and policymakers who need to create systems that accommodate conflicting views without bias.",
    "It signals a shift in how we design data systems, emphasizing the need for frameworks that can operate independently of specific interpretations."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The Ontological Neutrality Theorem explains that data systems must avoid taking sides in disagreements. Think of it like a referee in a game who doesn’t favor either team. This is important for everyone because it helps ensure fairness and accountability in how data is interpreted and used.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this theorem highlights the need for designing systems that can handle diverse interpretations without bias. It suggests a focus on user needs for accountability while keeping costs efficient. A practical implication could be creating flexible data models that adapt to various user frameworks.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the theorem emphasizes that ontological designs must be free from causal and normative commitments. This means that any ontology must represent entities without making assumptions about their interactions or moral implications. Designers should focus on identity and persistence conditions while keeping interpretation external."
