    "eli12": "The UK plans to stop animal testing for skin irritants by the end of next year, and Botox testing on mice by 2027. Think of it like switching from using a hammer to a more precise tool for delicate work. This matters because it could lead to safer products without harming animals.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this announcement signals a shift in regulatory expectations. Understanding user demand for ethical products could drive innovation in alternative testing methods. Companies may need to invest in new technologies to meet these upcoming standards efficiently.",
    "engineer": "The strategy outlines a phased approach to eliminate animal testing, with a focus on developing alternative methods. Researchers will need to explore in vitro testing and computational models, which are becoming more viable. This transition could lead to advancements in safety testing frameworks, but it requires significant investment in R&D."
