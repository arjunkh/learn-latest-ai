However, many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e., soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research explores counterfactual inference in cyclic structural causal models (SCMs), challenging the traditional reliance on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This study highlights how real-world systems, like biological ones, often have feedback loops that complicate analysis. By focusing on shift-scale interventions, which modify a variable's mechanism, the research opens new avenues for understanding causal relationships. This matters now as it could enhance our ability to model complex systems more accurately.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research could significantly benefit fields like biology and economics, where feedback loops are common, improving decision-making and predictions.",
    "It indicates a shift in causal inference methods, suggesting that models need to adapt to more complex, real-world scenarios, which could influence future research directions."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to understand how a plant grows, but you only look at it from the outside without considering how it interacts with its environment. This research tackles that issue by examining how feedback loops affect growth. By focusing on cyclic models, it could help us make better predictions about complex systems, making this relevant for everyone interested in how things work together in nature.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the need to consider complex interactions in user behavior. Traditional models may overlook important feedback loops, leading to less effective strategies. Understanding these cyclic dependencies could improve product design and marketing approaches, ultimately enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of cyclic SCMs in counterfactual inference, moving beyond the limitations of DAGs. It introduces shift-scale interventions, which allow for nuanced adjustments to a variable's mechanism. This approach could lead to more accurate modeling of systems with feedback loops, enabling better predictions and insights."
