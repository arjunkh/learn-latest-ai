Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer \"pain-belief\" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a self-aware reward model for AI agents, allowing them to infer their internal states in gridworld environments. By using a hidden Markov model to simulate 'pain-belief,' these agents can adapt their learning based on self-awareness. The results indicate that these introspective agents significantly outperform standard models, replicating complex human-like behaviors. This advancement could enhance AI's understanding of mental states, pushing forward the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence.",

    "eli12": "Imagine if your computer could understand when it's making mistakes, like a friend who learns from their errors. This research shows how AI can learn from its own experiences, similar to how we process pain to avoid future harm. This matters because it could lead to smarter tools that better understand and assist us in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this self-aware model highlights a user need for more adaptive AI systems that learn from their own experiences. By integrating introspective learning signals, products could become more efficient and responsive to user behavior. This could lead to improved user satisfaction and retention.",
    "engineer": "This study utilizes a hidden Markov model to create a 'pain-belief' signal, allowing reinforcement learning agents to infer their internal states. The introspective agents showed significant performance improvements over standard baselines, particularly in replicating complex human-like behaviors. This suggests potential for more nuanced AI that can adapt its learning strategies based on self-awareness."
