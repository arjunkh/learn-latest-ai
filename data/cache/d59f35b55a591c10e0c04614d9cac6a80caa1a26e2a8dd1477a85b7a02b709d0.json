  "speedrun": "A recent MIT study reveals that using large language models (LLMs) can lead to decreased brain activity, suggesting a potential long-term impact on cognitive function. The study found that participants exerted less mental effort while using LLMs, and this reduced effort may carry over into future tasks. This finding is significant as it raises questions about our reliance on AI and its effects on mental engagement in various activities.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This has immediate implications for students and professionals who may rely on AI tools, potentially leading to diminished critical thinking skills.",
    "At a broader level, this could signal a shift in how society values cognitive effort versus efficiency, affecting educational and workplace dynamics."

    "eli12": "Imagine using a calculator so often that you forget how to do basic math. The MIT study shows that when we use AI tools like LLMs, our brains might not work as hard, even later on. This is important because if we get too comfortable relying on AI, we could lose our ability to think critically and solve problems ourselves.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study highlights a user need for balance. While AI tools can enhance efficiency, they might also reduce users' cognitive engagement over time. Understanding this trade-off could guide product design, ensuring that tools encourage active thinking rather than passive use.",
    "engineer": "The study indicates that using LLMs leads to a measurable drop in brain activity among users. Although specific metrics were not disclosed, the implications suggest a need for engineers to consider cognitive load when developing AI interfaces. Balancing ease of use with mental engagement could be crucial in future AI applications."
