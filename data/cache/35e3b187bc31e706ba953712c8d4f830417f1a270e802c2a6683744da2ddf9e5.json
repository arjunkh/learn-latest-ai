  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.14788v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Subnational location data of disaster events are critical for risk assessment and disaster risk reduction. Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries. Applied to the EM-DAT dataset from 2000 to 2024, the workflow geocodes 14,215 events across 17,948 unique locations. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual intervention, covers all disaster types, enables cross-verification across multiple sources, and allows flexible remapping to preferred frameworks. Beyond the dataset, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract and structure geographic information from unstructured text, offering a scalable and reliable method for related analyses.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers developed a new automated workflow using large language models (LLMs) to geocode disaster events, transforming messy text data into structured location information. This system processed 14,215 events from the EM-DAT dataset, covering nearly 18,000 unique locations without any manual input. It cross-references multiple sources like OpenStreetMap and assigns reliability scores to ensure accuracy. This advancement matters now as it enhances disaster risk assessment and response capabilities globally.",

    "eli12": "This new system uses AI to turn messy disaster location data into clear, usable information. Imagine trying to find a restaurant with a poorly written address; this tool cleans up the data so responders can find where help is needed. For everyday people, this means faster and more effective responses to disasters, potentially saving lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this development highlights a user need for accurate, structured data in disaster response. It can reduce costs associated with manual data entry and improve efficiency in emergency planning. A practical implication is that integrating this technology could enhance the reliability of disaster management platforms.",
    "engineer": "The workflow employs GPT-4o to clean and geocode disaster event data, achieving automation without manual intervention. By cross-referencing three geoinformation repositories, it assigns reliability scores to locations, enhancing data integrity. This method processes 14,215 events, showcasing LLMs' potential in transforming unstructured text into precise geographic information."
