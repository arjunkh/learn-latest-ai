    "eli12": "Pandas DataFrames are like tables in a spreadsheet, making it easier to organize and analyze data. You can create these tables from simple lists or complex arrays. Learning this tool helps everyday people understand and work with data, which is becoming increasingly important in our data-driven world.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, knowing how to use Pandas DataFrames can streamline data analysis processes, improving decision-making efficiency. By quickly initializing DataFrames from various data sources, teams can focus on insights rather than data wrangling. This can lead to faster product iterations and a better understanding of user needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Pandas DataFrames offer a flexible structure for data manipulation, supporting various data types. The ability to initialize DataFrames from dictionaries or NumPy arrays enhances versatility in data handling. However, users should be aware of performance considerations when working with large datasets."
