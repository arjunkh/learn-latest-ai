  "raw_body": "OpenAI expanded its data residency regions for ChatGPT and its API, giving enterprise users the option to store and process their data closest to their business operations and better comply with local regulations. This expansion removes one of the biggest compliance blockers preventing global enterprises from deploying ChatGPT at scale.\nData residency, often an overlooked piece of the enterprise AI puzzle, processes and governs data according to the laws and customs of the countries where it is stored. \nChatGPT Enterprise and Edu subscribers can now choose to have their data processed in: \n\nEurope (European Economic Area and Switzerland)\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nCanada\n\nJapan\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nIndia\n\nAustralia\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nOpenAI said in a blog post that it “plans to expand availability to additional regions over time.” \nCustomers can store data such as conversations, uploaded files, custom GPTs, and image-generation artifacts. This applies only to data at rest, not while it moves through a system or when it is used for inference. OpenAI’s documentation notes that, for now, inference residency remains available only in the U.S.  \nChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users can set up new workspaces with data residency. Enterprise customers on the API who have been approved for advanced data controls can enable data residency by creating a new project and selecting their preferred region.\nOpenAI first began offering data residency in Europe in February this year. The European Union has some of the strictest data regulations globally, based on the GDPR. \nThe importance of data residency\nEnterprises until now had fewer choices for processing data flowing through ChatGPT. For example, some organizational data would be processed under U.S. law rather than under European rules. \nEnterprises risk violating data compliance rules if their data at rest is processed elsewhere and does not meet strict policies. \n“With over 1 million business customers around the world directly using OpenAI, we have expanded where we offer data residency — allowing business customers to store data in certain regions, helping organizations meet local regulatory and data protection requirements,” the company said in its blog post. \nHowever, enterprises must also understand that if they are using a connector or integration within ChatGPT, those applications have different data residency rules. When OpenAI launched company knowledge for ChatGPT, it warned users that depending on the connector they use, data residency may be limited to the U.S.",

  "speedrun": "OpenAI has expanded its data residency options for ChatGPT and its API, allowing enterprises to store and process data closer to their operations. This includes regions like Europe, the UK, and Japan, addressing compliance challenges that previously hindered deployment. With over 1 million business customers, this move is crucial for organizations needing to adhere to local regulations. As OpenAI aims to add more regions, the significance of data residency in enterprise AI becomes even clearer.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This change immediately benefits enterprises needing to comply with local data laws, enabling them to manage data according to regional regulations.",
    "On a broader scale, this shift reflects an increasing demand for localized data solutions, highlighting the importance of compliance in global business operations."

    "eli12": "OpenAI now lets businesses choose where to store their data, like picking a local bank to keep your money safe. This helps companies follow local laws and protect sensitive information. For everyday people, it means that businesses can use AI tools more confidently, knowing they are following the rules.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means a significant enhancement in user trust and compliance capabilities. By allowing data residency, they can better meet customer needs for local data processing, potentially reducing legal risks and improving adoption rates. This could lead to more efficient project setups tailored to regional requirements.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, OpenAI's expansion of data residency allows enterprises to store data in various regions, including Europe and Asia, which is key for compliance with local laws. However, inference processing still occurs only in the U.S., which could present challenges for real-time applications. Understanding these residency rules is essential for engineers working with data-sensitive applications."
