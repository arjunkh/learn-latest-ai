The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.",

  "speedrun": "A new study explores how AI models can better recognize their own limitations. By using confidence signals, models can identify when they don't know something. This approach shows that higher confidence often leads to higher accuracy, and models maintain this calibration even on new data. This matters now because it could lead to more reliable AI systems that efficiently manage uncertainty, improving overall performance in various applications.",

    "eli12": "Imagine if your GPS could tell you when it wasn't sure about the best route. This study shows how AI models can learn to recognize their own uncertainty, improving their reliability. This matters because it means everyday tools could become smarter and more trustworthy, especially in important situations like finding directions or making decisions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights a user need for AI that can communicate its confidence levels. By implementing calibrated models, products could become more efficient, using smaller models to handle simpler tasks while larger models tackle complex problems. This could lead to cost savings and improved user experiences.",
    "engineer": "The study emphasizes the importance of model calibration, showing that higher confidence correlates with higher accuracy.
