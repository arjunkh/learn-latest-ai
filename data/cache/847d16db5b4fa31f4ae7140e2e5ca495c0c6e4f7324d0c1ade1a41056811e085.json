  "raw_body": "OpenAI has begun accepting submissions from third-party developers for their apps to be accessible directly in ChatGPT, and has launched a new App Directory (don't call it a \"store\"!) that can be opened from the ChatGPT sidebar and at the URL chatgpt.com/apps.\nThis means the 800 million+ users of OpenAI's hit chatbot can search for, discover and begin using newly approved third-party apps immediately. Once installed, apps can be triggered during conversations by mentioning them by name (using @) or selecting them from the tools menu.\nThe third-party app submission process officially went live last night, December 17, as OpenAI announced in a blog post and on its developer account on X, though the company notes it will be reviewing all new third-party app submissions before approving them for listing in the App Directory, and making them available to ChatGPT users, to ensure they comply with the company's public guidelines. Apps that pass OpenAI’s review process will begin rolling out to users starting early 2026.\nFor those enterprises who want to get in on the action with their own ChatGPT apps, OpenAI said it will host a public webinar “Build Hour” event for third-party developers on January 21, where OpenAI engineers will walk through how to build, submit, and design apps for ChatGPT, using real-world examples and taking questions.\nApp Directory vs. GPT Store\nThis whole effort marks the start of a broader developer ecosystem beyond the small set of curated partners OpenAI launched its Apps standard development kit (SDK) earlier this fall, and seems to be fulfilling some of the hype that ensued back when OpenAI debuted its \"GPT Store\" back in early 2024, nearly two years ago. \nHowever, despite the pledge of revenue sharing that OpenAI made back then, it hasn't since provided many updates on the GPT Store, nor have we heard much from GPT builders about making substantive revenue from it. \nBut while those custom, user-generated GPTs were limited primarily to text-based experiences, the new ChatGPT App Directory and SDK features allow for a far more interactive experience including user accessible buttons, maps, multi-views, sliders, shaders, and other interaction modalities. The GPT Store also still remains available now.\nMonetization, restrictions, and review process\nIn this early phase, ChatGPT apps may link out to external websites to complete purchases for physical goods only. \nSelling digital goods, subscriptions, or in‑app services isn't yet allowed, though OpenAI says it is exploring additional monetization options over time.\nAll apps must:\n\nComply with OpenAI’s usage policies\n\nBe suitable for general audiences, including teens\n\nInclude a clear privacy policy and support contact\n\nAvoid advertising, deceptive behavior, or prohibited commerce categories\n\nDevelopers submit apps through the OpenAI Developer Platform, where they can track review status. Only one version of an app can be under review at a time.\nWhat this means for developers and users\nOpenAI first introduced the Apps SDK at its DevDay conference in October, positioning it as a way to build “apps inside of ChatGPT.” CEO Sam Altman described the vision as enabling “a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized.”\nBuilt on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) developed by rival Anthropic, the Apps SDK lets developers connect external services, fetch real-time context, trigger actions, and render UI directly inside ChatGPT. \nUntil now, ChatGPT apps were limited to a list of seven pilot partners including:\n\nBooking.com\n\nCanva\n\nCoursera\n\nExpedia\n\nFigma\n\nSpotify\n\nZillow\n\nThat list has since expanded to dozens of new apps, including popular software like Adobe PhotoShop (and Acrobat and Express), Github, Replit, Gmail and Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, Mailchimp, Stripe, and many more. \nAnd with general submissions now open, any verified developer—from solo builders to large enterprises—can build and submit apps for ChatGPT, provided they meet OpenAI’s quality, safety, and privacy standards.\nFor users, the change means ChatGPT can now act as a hub for specialized tools and workflows. Apps can extend conversations by pulling in live data, rendering interactive interfaces, or taking actions on a user’s behalf—like designing a presentation, searching for housing, or interacting with an external service—without leaving the chat.\nApps can appear in several formats, including:\n\nInline cards or carousels inside the conversation\n\nFullscreen views for immersive tasks like maps or slide decks\n\nPicture‑in‑picture modes for video, tutorials, or live sessions\n\nThe goal, OpenAI says, is to keep everything feeling conversational while adding real utility.\nHow ChatGPT is handling Apps data\nOne of the biggest open questions around ChatGPT apps is how user data is handled when third‑party apps are involved. Based on OpenAI’s documentation and guidelines, here’s what is clear—and what remains unanswered.\nWhat OpenAI has stated clearly:\n\nWhen a user connects to an app, ChatGPT discloses what types of data may be shared with the third party and surfaces the app’s privacy policy before connection.\n\nThird‑party developers are responsible for how their apps handle data once received.\n\nApps must minimize data collection, requesting only what is necessary to perform a specific task.\n\nApps are prohibited from requesting full chat transcripts, broad contextual data “just in case,” or sensitive personal data.\n\nAny action that sends data outside ChatGPT or modifies external systems must be clearly labeled and require user confirmation.\n\nApps must not reconstruct or infer a user’s full chat history and must avoid undisclosed tracking or profiling.\n\nWhat OpenAI has not clarified publicly:\n\nWhether OpenAI itself retains or logs the data passed between ChatGPT and third‑party apps.\n\nWhether data exchanged with apps can be used for model training or internal analytics.\n\nHow long, if at all, OpenAI stores metadata or interaction traces related to app usage.\n\nAs a result, while OpenAI emphasizes strong guardrails for developers and transparency for users, it has not explicitly detailed OpenAI’s own role as a data processor in app interactions. That ambiguity has already drawn scrutiny and remains an open issue as the app ecosystem expands.\nThe bigger picture\nWith app submissions now open and an App Directory live, ChatGPT is no longer just a conversational AI—it’s becoming a distribution platform for AI‑native software.\nDevelopers get access to a massive built‑in audience, while users gain tools that can be discovered and used at the moment they’re needed, directly inside a conversation.\nOpenAI describes this as “just the beginning.” But with the infrastructure now in place, the shift from chatbot to app ecosystem is officially underway.",

    "eli12": "OpenAI's new App Directory lets developers create apps that work directly with ChatGPT, making it easier for users to find and use helpful tools. Think of it like adding new apps to your phone, but now they work right inside your chat. This change matters because it means everyday people can access tailored solutions while chatting, making their interactions more productive and engaging.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development opens up opportunities to meet user needs with innovative tools that integrate directly into ChatGPT. The ability to create interactive experiences could enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, understanding the review process and compliance requirements will be crucial for successful app submissions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, OpenAI's App SDK allows developers to create interactive apps that utilize the open Model Context Protocol (MCP). This enables real-time data fetching and user interface rendering directly within ChatGPT. Developers must ensure their apps adhere to OpenAI's privacy and data handling guidelines, which emphasize minimal data collection and user transparency."
