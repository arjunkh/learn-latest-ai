  "raw_body": "Vibe coding is evolving and with it are the leading AI-powered coding services and tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Code. \nAs of today, the service will be available via the web and, in preview, on the Claude iOS app, giving developers access to additional asynchronous capabilities. Previously, it was available through the terminal on developers' PCs with support for Git, Docker, Kubernetes, npm, pip, AWS CLI, etc., and as an extension for Microsoft's open source VS Code editor and other JetBrains-powered integrated development environments (IDEs) via Claude Agent.   \n“Claude Code on the web lets you kick off coding sessions without opening your terminal,” Anthropic said in a blog post. “Connect your GitHub repositories, describe what you need, and Claude handles the implementation. Each session runs in its own isolated environment with real-time progress tracking, and you can actively steer Claude to adjust course as it’s working through tasks.”\nThis allows users to run coding projects asynchronously, a trend that many enterprises are looking for. \nThe web version of Claude Code, currently in research preview, will be available to Pro and Max users. However, web Claude Code will be subject to the same rate limits as other versions. Anthropic throttled rate limits to Claude and Claude Code after the unexpected popularity of the coding tool in July, which enabled some users to run Claude Code overnight. \nAnthropic is now ensuring Claude Code comes closer to matching the availability of rival OpenAI's Codex AI coding platform, powered by a variant of GPT-5, which launches on mobile and the web back in mid September 2025.\nParallel usage\nAnthropic said running Claude Code in the cloud means teams can “now run multiple tasks in parallel across different repositories from a single interface and ship faster with automatic PR creation and clear change summaries.”\nOne of the big draws of coding agents is giving developers the ability to run multiple coding projects, such as bugfixes, at the same time. Google’s two coding agents, Jules and Code Assist, both offer asynchronous code generation and checks. Codex from OpenAI also lets people work in parallel. \nAnthropic said bringing Claude Code to the web won’t disrupt workflows, but noted running tasks in the cloud work best for tasks such as answering questions around projects and how repositories are mapped, bugfixes and for routine, well-defined tasks, and backend changes to verify any adjustments. \nWhile most developers will likely prefer to use Claude Code on a desktop, Anthropic said the mobile version could encourage more users to “explore coding with Claude on the go.”\nIsolated environments \nAnthropic insisted that Claude Code tasks on the cloud will have the same level of security as the earlier version. It runs on an “isolated sandbox environment with network and filesystem restrictions.” \nInteractions go through a secure proxy service, which the company said ensures the model only accesses authorized repositories.\nEnterprise users can customize which domains Claude Code can connect to. \nClaude Code is powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5, which Anthropic claims is the best coding model around. The company recently made Claude Haiku 4.5, a smaller version of Claude that also has strong coding capabilities, available to all Claude subscribers, including free users.",

  "speedrun": "Anthropic has expanded its Claude Code service to the web and iOS, allowing developers to run coding tasks asynchronously. This update lets users connect GitHub repositories and manage projects without needing a terminal. Each session operates in an isolated environment, providing real-time tracking and adjustments. This change matters now as it enhances productivity for developers, especially as they face increasing demand for parallel coding capabilities.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can now manage multiple coding tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and response times for project changes.",
    "This move signals a competitive shift in the AI coding landscape, as Anthropic aims to match the capabilities of OpenAI's Codex platform."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Anthropic's Claude Code is now available on the web and iOS, making coding easier for developers. Imagine being able to cook multiple dishes at once without cluttering your kitchen—that's what this service allows. It helps developers work on several projects at the same time, which is important as coding demands grow.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Claude Code's web and mobile access could enhance user experience by allowing developers to work more efficiently. This could lead to faster project delivery and reduced costs. The ability to run multiple tasks simultaneously might also attract more users looking for flexible coding solutions.",
    "engineer": "Claude Code runs on Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, designed for coding tasks in isolated environments. This setup allows for secure interactions with GitHub repositories while maintaining performance. The introduction of asynchronous capabilities positions Claude Code competitively against tools like OpenAI's Codex, which also supports parallel coding tasks."
