  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "GraphRAG is a new method for retrieving information that combines different techniques to work better and cost less. Think of it like using a map and GPS together to find the best route. This matters because it can help businesses save money while still getting the information they need quickly.",
    "pm": "For product managers, GraphRAG highlights a user need for efficient data retrieval without high costs. By implementing this hybrid approach, teams could enhance user experience while optimizing budget. This means better products that meet user demands without overspending.",
    "engineer": "GraphRAG employs hybrid pipelines that integrate various retrieval strategies, potentially improving recall rates compared to traditional dense graph models. This approach could lead to lower operational costs and increased efficiency. However, specific benchmarks and performance metrics would be essential to assess its effectiveness fully."
