  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.14448v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital (VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1 firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage, with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public and evolving resource available at vcbench.com, VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.",

  "speedrun": "VCBench has launched as the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital, addressing a field where traditional signals are weak and outcomes unpredictable. Initial evaluations show that top-tier firms outperform the market index by 2.9 times, while the benchmark boasts a 90% reduction in identity re-identification risk. This matters now because it creates a standardized, privacy-preserving tool for assessing potential in early-stage ventures, potentially transforming how investors evaluate startups.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "VCBench provides venture capitalists with a clearer framework for identifying promising founders, enhancing decision-making in an uncertain market.",
    "This benchmark reflects a shift towards data-driven investment strategies, likely influencing how firms assess potential in the tech startup ecosystem."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "VCBench is like a report card for startup founders, helping investors see who might succeed. It uses data to make predictions in an area where guessing is common. This tool could help everyday people by improving the chances of funding for innovative ideas that could benefit society.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, VCBench represents a new way to understand what makes a startup founder successful. By leveraging data-driven insights, they could refine their pitches and strategies to align better with investor expectations, potentially increasing their chances of securing funding.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, VCBench evaluates nine advanced large language models (LLMs) to predict founder success, with DeepSeek-V3 achieving over six times the baseline precision. The benchmark's design ensures privacy through anonymized profiles and rigorous adversarial testing, making it a robust tool for venture capital analysis."
