  "speedrun": "Recent advancements in few-shot prompting have led to a fivefold increase in coding performance for large language models (LLMs). By providing just a few examples, users can significantly enhance the model's ability to generate accurate code. This improvement is crucial as it allows developers to harness AI more effectively, potentially speeding up software development processes. The implications of this could reshape how coding tasks are approached in various industries.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can now achieve higher coding efficiency with minimal examples, streamlining their workflow and reducing time spent on coding tasks.",
    "This trend indicates a broader shift towards more intuitive AI tools that can adapt quickly to user needs, enhancing productivity across the tech landscape."

    "eli12": "Few-shot prompting is like teaching a child to draw by showing them just a couple of pictures. With a few examples, they can create their own versions. For everyday people, this means AI can help with tasks like coding without needing extensive training, making technology more accessible.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, leveraging few-shot prompting means meeting user needs for efficiency and speed. It reduces the time and resources required for coding, allowing teams to focus on higher-level tasks. This could lead to a more agile development process and faster product iterations.",
    "engineer": "Technically, few-shot prompting can boost LLM performance by refining its output with minimal input examples. This method has shown to increase coding accuracy significantly, making it a valuable tool for engineers. However, it’s important to consider that results may vary based on the complexity of the coding tasks involved."
