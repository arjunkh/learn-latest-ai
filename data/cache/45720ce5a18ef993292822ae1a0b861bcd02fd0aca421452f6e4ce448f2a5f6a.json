    "eli12": "Imagine taking a photo of a leaf and instantly knowing what plant it belongs to. That's what automatic plant leaf detection does by turning leaf features into numbers. This technology could help gardeners and farmers identify plants quickly, making their work easier and more efficient.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this technology addresses the need for quick and accurate plant identification. By lowering the time and cost associated with manual identification, it could enhance user experience in agricultural apps and tools. This could lead to increased adoption among farmers and researchers.",
    "engineer": "The system leverages deep learning to create embeddings from leaf images, capturing essential features for similarity comparison. By applying Euclidean similarity, it efficiently identifies plant species based on these numerical representations. However, the effectiveness of the model may depend on the quality and diversity of the training data."
