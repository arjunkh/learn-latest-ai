    "eli12": "Think of unstructured data like a messy attic filled with treasures. Most businesses have tons of this data, but it's hard to find what’s useful. New AI tools are helping to sift through it, uncovering insights that could improve how companies operate. This matters because it can lead to better services and products for everyday people.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, tapping into unstructured data could reveal customer needs and preferences that were previously hidden. This insight can enhance product development and marketing strategies, potentially reducing costs and increasing efficiency. The practical implication is that companies might create more targeted solutions that resonate with users.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, leveraging unstructured data requires advanced AI models capable of natural language processing and computer vision. These models can analyze text from customer complaints or extract insights from video footage, making previously inaccessible data actionable. However, challenges in data quality and integration still need to be addressed."
