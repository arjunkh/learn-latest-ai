  "raw_excerpt": "In 1943, while the world’s brightest physicists split atoms for the Manhattan Project, the American psychologist B.F. Skinner led his own secret government project to win World War II.  Skinner did not aim to build a new class of larger, more destructive weapons. Rather, he wanted to make conventional bombs more precise. The idea struck…",

    "eli12": "This article tells us about a psychologist named B.F. Skinner who trained pigeons to help make bombs more accurate during World War II. It's cool because it shows how studying animals can lead to new ideas in technology, like AI. This means that even unusual methods can help us solve big problems.",
    "pm": "Researchers and developers in AI can utilize insights from behavioral science to enhance machine learning algorithms. This approach can solve issues related to precision and decision-making in AI systems, giving businesses a competitive edge. However, there are risks in relying too heavily on unconventional methods without thorough validation.",
    "engineer": "The article discusses Skinner's use of operant conditioning to train pigeons, which can be likened to reinforcement learning in AI. This method emphasizes feedback loops for improving performance. However, the limitations include the scalability of such biological approaches and the ethical considerations in applying animal behavior to technology."
