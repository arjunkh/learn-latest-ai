  "speedrun": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are evolving to adapt to the rise of agentic AI, which can make decisions and take actions autonomously. This shift reflects how businesses have historically embraced new technologies, like mainframes and MRP systems, to streamline operations. As AI capabilities grow, organizations must rethink their approaches to ERP to leverage these advancements effectively. This transition is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in a tech-driven landscape.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses that adopt AI-enhanced ERP could see improved efficiency and decision-making, directly impacting their operational success.",
    "The shift towards AI in ERP systems indicates a broader trend of automation and intelligence in business processes, reshaping the industry landscape."

    "eli12": "Imagine ERP systems as the backbone of a business, organizing everything from finances to inventory. With AI, these systems could not only store data but also analyze it and make decisions on their own. This matters because it could save time and reduce errors, helping businesses run smoother and more efficiently.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, integrating AI into ERP systems means addressing user needs for smarter, more responsive tools. This could lead to reduced operational costs and increased efficiency. A practical implication is that businesses might need to reassess their current ERP solutions to ensure they can incorporate AI features effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the integration of agentic AI into ERP systems could involve advanced models that analyze data in real-time and automate decision-making processes. This evolution may require new architectures that support machine learning algorithms, ensuring scalability and responsiveness. However, organizations must also consider the complexities of data integration and system compatibility."
