  "speedrun": "Kevin Green, CMO of Hapax, emphasizes that smaller banks should not blindly follow larger banks into AI adoption. He points out that these institutions often require customized AI solutions to meet their unique needs. Rushed adoption can lead to significant pitfalls, including inefficiencies and misalignment with customer expectations. This discussion is timely as many smaller banks are navigating the complexities of AI integration in a competitive landscape.",

    "eli12": "Kevin Green from Hapax warns that smaller banks shouldn't just copy what big banks do with AI. They need special solutions that fit their unique situations. Think of it like wearing shoes; what fits one person might not fit another. This matters because if smaller banks get it wrong, they could struggle to serve their customers well.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Green's insights suggest that understanding the specific needs of smaller banks is crucial when developing AI solutions. Thereâ€™s a risk of wasted resources if products are too generic. A tailored approach could enhance efficiency and ensure that solutions truly address user needs, leading to better customer satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the call for tailored AI solutions highlights the limitations of one-size-fits-all models in banking. Smaller banks may require unique datasets and algorithms to address their specific challenges. This indicates a potential gap in current AI offerings that engineers could fill by developing more customized, adaptive systems."
