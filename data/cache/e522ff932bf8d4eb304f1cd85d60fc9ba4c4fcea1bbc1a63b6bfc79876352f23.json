  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.03550v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a \"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC), a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline, significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.",

  "speedrun": "A new method called Diffusion-AC has been developed to improve air traffic conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) using diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike traditional deep reinforcement learning methods that often get stuck in a single solution, Diffusion-AC can generate multiple effective actions. In high-density traffic scenarios, it achieves a 94.1% success rate and reduces near mid-air collisions by 59%. This advancement is crucial as global air traffic continues to rise, requiring safer and more efficient management.",

    "eli12": "The new Diffusion-AC method makes air traffic management smarter by allowing it to consider multiple options when resolving conflicts between planes. Think of it like a GPS that not only gives you the fastest route but also suggests several alternatives if traffic changes. This matters because it could help prevent accidents and keep air travel safer as more people fly.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in aviation tech, Diffusion-AC represents a significant user need: safer air travel with more efficient conflict resolution. By addressing the limitations of existing models, it could lower operational costs related to accidents and delays. Implementing this technology could enhance user trust and satisfaction in air traffic systems.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Diffusion-AC integrates diffusion probabilistic models to overcome the unimodal bias seen in traditional deep reinforcement learning approaches. It models decision-making as a reverse denoising process, allowing for a multimodal action distribution. In simulations, it outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving a 94.1% success rate in high-density scenarios while reducing near mid-air collisions by 59%, showcasing its effectiveness in safety-critical applications."
