  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.22199v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG systems enhance large language models by grounding responses in external knowledge bases, but conventional RAG architectures operate with static corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions. We introduce Bidirectional RAG, a novel RAG architecture that enables safe corpus expansion through validated write back of high quality generated responses. Our system employs a multi stage acceptance layer combining grounding verification (NLI based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection to prevent hallucination pollution while enabling knowledge accumulation. Across four datasets Natural Questions, TriviaQA, HotpotQA, Stack Overflow with three random seeds 12 experiments per system, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage nearly doubling Standard RAG 20.33% while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back 140 vs 500. Our work demonstrates that self improving RAG is feasible and safe when governed by rigorous validation, offering a practical path toward RAG systems that learn from deployment.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed a new architecture called Bidirectional RAG that allows Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to evolve by safely expanding their knowledge base through user interactions. This system achieves an impressive 40.58% average coverage, nearly doubling the standard RAG's 20.33%, while using 72% fewer documents. This advancement is significant as it shows that RAG systems can improve over time without compromising safety, making them more efficient and reliable.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This innovation could directly benefit developers and researchers who rely on RAG systems for accurate information retrieval, enhancing their tools' effectiveness.",
    "On a broader scale, it indicates a shift towards more adaptive AI systems that learn from real-world use, potentially transforming how AI integrates knowledge over time."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The new Bidirectional RAG system helps AI models learn and improve by safely adding new information from user interactions. Think of it like a library that not only collects books but also updates its collection based on what readers find useful. This matters because it could make AI responses more accurate and relevant for everyone, improving how we interact with technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Bidirectional RAG represents a way to meet user needs for accurate and up-to-date information without overwhelming systems with unnecessary data. It offers a cost-efficient method to enhance AI performance while maintaining safety. This could lead to better user experiences and increased trust in AI applications.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Bidirectional RAG employs a multi-stage acceptance layer that includes grounding verification techniques like entailment checking and novelty detection. In tests across four datasets, it achieved an average coverage of 40.58%, significantly outperforming standard RAG's 20.33% while using only 140 documents compared to 500 in naive write-back. This demonstrates a promising approach to improving RAG systems safely."
