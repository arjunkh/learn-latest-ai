  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.25014v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading (browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably, ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research introduced Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in in-game trading, addressing their struggle with procedural flows. ASTP achieved over 99% compliance with state tracking and 99.3% accuracy in price calculations across 300 dialogues. Notably, it allowed smaller models to perform comparably to larger ones while significantly reducing response times from 21.2 seconds to just 2.4 seconds. This development could restore player trust and improve user experiences in dynamic gaming environments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Gamers benefit immediately, as improved LLMs could enhance trust and engagement in trading mechanics within games.",
    "This reflects a broader trend in gaming where efficiency and accuracy are increasingly prioritized, potentially reshaping how developers approach AI integration."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Imagine trying to play a board game where the rules keep changing unexpectedly. That's how players feel when LLMs don't follow trading procedures. The new ASTP method helps LLMs stick to the rules, making trading more reliable. This matters because it could lead to smoother and more enjoyable gaming experiences for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ASTP offers a way to meet user expectations for reliability in trading systems. By ensuring LLMs follow rules accurately, developers could reduce frustration and increase user retention. This method also highlights a cost-effective approach, as smaller models can now deliver the same performance as larger ones, saving resources.",
    "engineer": "ASTP improves the reliability of LLMs in trading scenarios by enforcing explicit state tracking. It achieved over 99% compliance and 99.3% accuracy in price calculations through a structured prompting method. Additionally, it demonstrated that smaller models like Gemini-2.5-Flash can match the performance of larger models while significantly reducing response times, which is crucial for real-time applications."
