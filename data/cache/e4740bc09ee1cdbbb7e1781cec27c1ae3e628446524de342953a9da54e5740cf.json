This change could make it easier for everyday businesses to use AI tools without worrying about data safety.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means a clearer path to integrating AI into products, especially for those in strict industries. Reduced complexity in data governance could lower costs and improve efficiency. A practical implication is that companies may now be more willing to invest in AI solutions, knowing their data is handled properly.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, OpenAI's advancements in data residency could allow enterprises to deploy AI models while ensuring compliance with data sovereignty laws. This shift may involve adapting existing models to operate within specified geographic boundaries. However, organizations must still evaluate the trade-offs between flexibility and regulatory adherence."
