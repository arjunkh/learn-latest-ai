  "speedrun": "Inclusion AI and Ant Group have introduced a groundbreaking leaderboard for large language models (LLMs) that evaluates their performance based on real-world applications rather than traditional lab benchmarks. This innovative approach emphasizes practical utility and effectiveness, providing a more accurate reflection of how LLMs function in everyday scenarios, which is crucial for developers and businesses relying on these technologies.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This new leaderboard allows developers to make informed decisions about LLMs based on their actual performance in production, enhancing the reliability of AI applications.",
    "By focusing on real-world data, this initiative could drive improvements in LLM design and deployment, ultimately leading to more effective and user-friendly AI solutions."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "A new leaderboard shows how well language models work in real apps instead of just in tests. This is exciting because it helps people see which models are truly useful in everyday life. It means better tools for everyone, making technology more helpful.",
    "pm": "Developers and businesses will use this leaderboard to choose the best LLMs for their applications. It solves the problem of relying on lab results, which may not reflect real-world performance. This approach provides a competitive edge by ensuring that companies adopt models that truly work, while also highlighting potential risks if they choose poorly performing models.",
    "engineer": "The technical approach involves collecting performance data from LLMs deployed in various production environments, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. This architecture focuses on real-time metrics rather than controlled lab conditions, which may introduce variability. However, challenges include ensuring data consistency and addressing the diverse contexts in which LLMs operate, which could affect performance comparisons."
