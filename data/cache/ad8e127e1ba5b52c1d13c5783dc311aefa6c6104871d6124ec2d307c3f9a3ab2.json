  "speedrun": "Students at the Huang-Hobbs BioMaker Space are designing a chemically powered model car, a project led by Jaden Chizuruoke May ’29 and his teammates. This hands-on engineering experience allows them to engage with biological systems in a safe environment. The initiative not only fosters creativity but also equips students with practical skills. As educational institutions emphasize STEM, such projects are increasingly important for developing future innovators.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Students gain practical skills in engineering and biology, enhancing their learning experience and preparing them for future careers.",
    "This project reflects a broader trend in education toward hands-on, experiential learning, which could reshape how students engage with STEM fields."

    "eli12": "At the Huang-Hobbs BioMaker Space, students are building a car powered by chemicals. This project helps them learn about engineering and biology in a fun way. Think of it like cooking—just as you mix ingredients to create a dish, these students mix concepts to create a working model. This matters because it makes learning interactive and prepares students for real-world challenges.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this project highlights the importance of hands-on learning in developing future talent. By engaging students in practical tasks, it addresses the user need for experiential education. This could lead to more innovative thinkers who are ready to tackle real-world problems, ultimately benefiting industries that rely on STEM skills.",
    "engineer": "The project focuses on designing a chemically powered car, which involves understanding both engineering principles and biological systems. While specific models or benchmarks are not mentioned, the hands-on approach emphasizes iterative design and experimentation. This method allows students to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context, which is crucial for developing engineering skills."
