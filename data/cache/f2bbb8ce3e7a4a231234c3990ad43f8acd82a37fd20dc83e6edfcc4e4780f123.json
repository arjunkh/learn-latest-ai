  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.00097v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated theorem proving in Euclidean geometry, particularly for International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems, remains a major challenge and an important research focus in Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method for geometry theorem proving that runs entirely on CPUs without relying on neural network-based inference. Our initial study shows that a simple random strategy for adding auxiliary points can achieve silver-medal level human performance on IMO. Building on this, we propose HAGeo, a Heuristic-based method for adding Auxiliary constructions in Geometric deduction that solves 28 of 30 problems on the IMO-30 benchmark, achieving gold-medal level performance and surpassing AlphaGeometry, a competitive neural network-based approach, by a notable margin. To evaluate our method and existing approaches more comprehensively, we further construct HAGeo-409, a benchmark consisting of 409 geometry problems with human-assessed difficulty levels. Compared with the widely used IMO-30, our benchmark poses greater challenges and provides a more precise evaluation, setting a higher bar for geometry theorem proving.",

  "speedrun": "A new method for solving geometry problems has been developed, achieving impressive results in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Named HAGeo, this heuristic-based approach solved 28 out of 30 problems on the IMO-30 benchmark, outperforming the neural network model AlphaGeometry. This advancement signifies a major leap in automated theorem proving without relying on deep learning, which could reshape how we approach complex geometric problems in AI.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This breakthrough could help students and educators by providing tools that enhance learning in geometry, making complex concepts more accessible.",
    "It indicates a shift toward more efficient, CPU-based methods in AI, potentially reducing costs and increasing the speed of problem-solving in various applications."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to solve a tricky puzzle without any hints. That's what geometry theorem proving is like. The new method, HAGeo, acts like a clever friend who knows just the right tricks to help you get to the answer faster. This matters because it could help students and teachers tackle geometry challenges more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, HAGeo represents a shift towards efficient, non-neural network solutions for complex problems. This could lower development costs and increase speed, allowing for faster iterations in educational tools or software. The ability to solve more problems accurately could also enhance user satisfaction and engagement.",
    "engineer": "HAGeo utilizes a heuristic approach to add auxiliary constructions in geometric proofs, achieving gold-medal performance on the IMO-30 benchmark. It solved 28 out of 30 problems, surpassing AlphaGeometry, a neural network model, by a significant margin. The introduction of the HAGeo-409 benchmark offers a more rigorous evaluation framework, pushing the boundaries of geometry theorem proving."
