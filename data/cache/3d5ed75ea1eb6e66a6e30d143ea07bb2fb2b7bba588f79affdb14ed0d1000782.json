  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.00039v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dynamic pricing in retail requires policies that adapt to shifting demand while coordinating decisions across related products. We present a systematic empirical study of multi-agent reinforcement learning for retail price optimization, comparing a strong MAPPO baseline with a graph-attention-augmented variant (MAPPO+GAT) that leverages learned interactions among products. Using a simulated pricing environment derived from real transaction data, we evaluate profit, stability across random seeds, fairness across products, and training efficiency under a standardized evaluation protocol. The results indicate that MAPPO provides a robust and reproducible foundation for portfolio-level price control, and that MAPPO+GAT further enhances performance by sharing information over the product graph without inducing excessive price volatility. These results indicate that graph-integrated MARL provides a more scalable and stable solution than independent learners for dynamic retail pricing, offering practical advantages in multi-product decision-making.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduced Graph-Attentive MAPPO, an advanced method for dynamic retail pricing using multi-agent reinforcement learning. This approach enhances price optimization by incorporating product relationships, leading to improved profits and stability. The research shows that MAPPO+GAT outperforms traditional MAPPO by sharing information across products, resulting in better decision-making without causing price fluctuations. This advancement is significant as it could reshape how retailers adapt to changing market conditions.",

    "eli12": "Think of retail pricing like adjusting the temperature in a room. If one area gets too hot, you want to cool it down without freezing another corner. The new MAPPO+GAT method helps retailers adjust prices across multiple products smoothly, allowing them to respond to changes in demand. This matters because it could lead to better deals for consumers as retailers become more efficient.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding MAPPO+GAT means recognizing a tool that could enhance pricing efficiency across product lines. By leveraging relationships between products, teams could meet user demand more effectively while keeping costs stable. This could lead to improved customer satisfaction and potentially higher sales.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, MAPPO+GAT builds on multi-agent reinforcement learning by integrating graph attention mechanisms. This allows the model to learn interactions between products, resulting in enhanced performance metrics like profit stability and training efficiency. The findings suggest that this approach could outperform independent learners, making it a compelling option for dynamic pricing applications."
