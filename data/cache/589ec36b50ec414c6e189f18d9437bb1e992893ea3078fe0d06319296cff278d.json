This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper explores whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity, focusing on two key premises: that AI will become extremely powerful and that this power could lead to humanity's destruction. The authors propose a taxonomy of survival scenarios where either premise fails, such as scientific limitations or effective detection of harmful AI. Understanding these scenarios is crucial as debates around AI safety intensify, especially following advancements like ChatGPT.",

    "eli12": "The paper looks at the risks that powerful AI might pose to humanity and suggests ways we might survive these threats. It breaks down different scenarios where either AI fails to become too powerful or we find ways to keep it safe. This matters because understanding these risks can help everyone, from tech enthusiasts to everyday users, feel more secure about the future of AI.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of considering AI safety in product development. By understanding the potential risks and survival scenarios, they can align their products with safety measures, potentially reducing liability and fostering user trust. This could lead to more responsible AI innovations that prioritize user safety.",
    "engineer": "The paper introduces a taxonomy to evaluate AI existential risks, analyzing scenarios where either AI power is limited or its harmful intentions are mitigated. It outlines that the probability of AI-induced doom (P(doom)) can vary significantly based on these scenarios. Engineers should consider these frameworks when developing AI systems to ensure they incorporate safety features and risk assessments."
