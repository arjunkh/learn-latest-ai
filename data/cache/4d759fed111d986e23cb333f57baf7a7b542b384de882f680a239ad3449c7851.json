  "speedrun": "Infinite Threads, a project from MIT's Undergraduate Association, is tackling textile waste by collecting lightly used clothing. Massachusetts has already banned clothing disposal in landfills, where textiles make up 5% of the waste. This initiative is crucial as polyester clothing can take up to 200 years to decompose, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable solutions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Students and community members can easily donate clothing, reducing landfill waste and promoting sustainability within their local environment.",
    "This initiative could inspire similar projects across colleges and communities, potentially reshaping how society views textile waste and recycling."

    "eli12": "Imagine if every shirt you owned took 200 years to disappear! That’s the reality with polyester clothing. Infinite Threads helps MIT students donate their gently used clothes instead of tossing them, making it easier to care for our planet. This matters because it shows how small actions can lead to big changes in reducing waste.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this initiative highlights a growing consumer demand for sustainability. Understanding how to facilitate easy donation processes can create a competitive edge. A practical next step is to explore partnerships with local organizations to expand recycling options and enhance user engagement.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Infinite Threads focuses on efficient collection and redistribution of textiles, addressing a significant environmental issue. However, scalability remains a challenge as it relies on community participation. Comparing this approach to traditional recycling methods, it emphasizes direct reuse over processing, which could reduce overall carbon footprints."
