    "eli12": "OpenAI's new model is like a clear window into the world of AI, showing how it thinks and learns. Unlike older models that are hard to understand, this one breaks down complex ideas into simpler parts. This clarity could help everyone, from students to professionals, feel more comfortable using AI in their daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this new model presents an opportunity to create user-friendly AI applications. By understanding how AI works, they can better address user needs and enhance efficiency. This could lead to products that are not only more effective but also more trusted by users.",
    "engineer": "The experimental model from OpenAI utilizes a more interpretable architecture, which contrasts with traditional black-box models. This shift allows engineers to analyze decision-making processes more effectively, potentially leading to improved performance metrics. However, it remains important to evaluate how this simplicity impacts the model's capabilities in complex tasks."
