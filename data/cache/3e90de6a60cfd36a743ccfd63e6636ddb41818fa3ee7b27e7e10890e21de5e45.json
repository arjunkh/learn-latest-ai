  "speedrun": "Organizations are increasingly cautious about using third-party AI services due to data security concerns. Internal audits have highlighted these services as potential vulnerabilities, especially when they access proprietary bidstream data. As a result, many companies are exploring local AI models to maintain control over their data while still enhancing performance. This shift is significant as it reflects a growing priority on data security in the AI landscape.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies using programmatic advertising could see immediate benefits from local AI models, reducing data exposure risks. This change helps them safeguard proprietary information while leveraging AI capabilities.",
    "The broader market may witness a shift towards local AI solutions, indicating a trend of prioritizing data security over reliance on third-party services. This could reshape how businesses approach AI integration."

    "eli12": "Using local AI models is like keeping your valuables in a safe at home instead of a shared bank. It allows companies to protect their sensitive data while still using AI to improve their advertising strategies. This matters because it helps everyday businesses feel more secure about their information while still benefiting from technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend towards local AI models highlights a growing user need for data security in programmatic advertising. By investing in local solutions, companies could potentially reduce costs associated with data breaches and improve efficiency in their operations. This shift may also open new opportunities for product development focused on security.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, local AI models can offer enhanced data security by processing information on-site rather than relying on external servers. This approach minimizes the risk of exposing proprietary bidstream data to third-party services. However, engineers must ensure that these local models maintain performance benchmarks comparable to their cloud-based counterparts."
