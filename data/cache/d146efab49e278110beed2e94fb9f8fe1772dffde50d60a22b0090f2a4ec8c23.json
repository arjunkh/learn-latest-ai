Traditional approaches often rely on predefined validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.",

  "speedrun": "A new method called the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique) has been introduced to assess model validity in decision-making. Unlike traditional methods that depend on predefined validity frames, DOTechnique focuses on whether different models lead to the same decisions. This approach enhances efficiency by integrating domain constraints and symbolic reasoning. It matters now because it could significantly improve how we validate models in complex decision-making scenarios, especially when clear validity boundaries are lacking.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Decision-makers in fields like autonomous driving could benefit from more reliable model assessments, improving safety and efficiency.",
    "This technique indicates a shift towards more adaptable and context-aware validation methods in AI, reflecting evolving needs in model assessment."

    "eli12": "The Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique) helps check if models are valid based on the decisions they make, rather than just how closely they match outputs. Think of it like ensuring different GPS apps lead you to the same destination, even if their routes differ. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to safer and more reliable technology in areas like self-driving cars.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, DOTechnique highlights a user need for reliable model validation in decision-making tools. It could reduce costs by streamlining the validation process and improving efficiency. A practical implication is that teams could more confidently deploy models without exhaustive validation steps, accelerating product development.",
    "engineer": "The DOTechnique offers a new way to assess model validity by focusing on decision consistency instead of output similarity. By evaluating surrogate models against high-fidelity models, it identifies validity regions more efficiently, even without explicit boundaries. This approach could enhance computational efficiency in simulations, particularly in complex systems like autonomous vehicles."
