  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.09575v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.",

  "speedrun": "The Second International Workshop on Next-Generation Language Models for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (NeLaMKRR 2025) aims to bridge the gap between traditional logic-based reasoning and modern transformer-based language models. Researchers will explore how these models can exhibit reasoning abilities as they grow larger and are trained on more data. Key focuses include analyzing reasoning capabilities and enhancing language models with knowledge representation techniques. This matters now as improving reasoning in AI could lead to more reliable applications in critical areas.",

    "eli12": "This workshop is like a gathering of chefs who want to blend traditional cooking with modern techniques. They're exploring how newer language models can think and reason better, just like humans do. This matters because if AI can reason more effectively, it could help us make better decisions in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this workshop highlights a user need for AI tools that can reason and make informed decisions. By integrating knowledge representation into language models, products could become more efficient and reliable. This could lead to innovative applications in various industries, enhancing user experience.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the workshop focuses on evaluating reasoning abilities in transformer-based language models and comparing them with traditional knowledge representation methods. Researchers aim to inject reasoning capabilities into these models through neuro-symbolic approaches. Understanding these advancements could lead to better benchmarks for measuring AI reasoning performance."
