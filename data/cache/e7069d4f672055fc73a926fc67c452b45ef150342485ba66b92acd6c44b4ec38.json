    "eli12": "Imagine using a computer to design a superhero virus that specifically targets and defeats bad bacteria. That's what researchers at Stanford have done with AI. By creating new genetic codes, they've made viruses that can replicate and attack harmful germs. This matters because it could lead to new ways to fight infections that are hard to treat today.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a growing need for innovative solutions in healthcare. AI's ability to design effective treatments could lead to more efficient drug development processes. Companies focusing on biotech might consider how to integrate AI into their strategies for tackling antibiotic resistance and improving patient outcomes.",
    "engineer": "The Stanford team utilized AI to generate novel genetic sequences for viruses, which were then tested for their ability to replicate and kill bacteria. This approach shows the potential of machine learning models in synthetic biology, with implications for creating tailored treatments. However, the scalability and safety of these AI-designed viruses will need thorough evaluation before practical applications."
