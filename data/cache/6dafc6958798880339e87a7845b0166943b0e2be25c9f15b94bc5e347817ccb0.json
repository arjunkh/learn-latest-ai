  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.13700v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework uses large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured patient records, addressing the time-consuming manual chart review process in clinical research. This system was tested against an expert-annotated dataset, achieving high accuracy and uncovering errors often missed by human reviewers. By streamlining data extraction, it could significantly reduce the workload for researchers and improve the consistency of information captured from electronic health records. This is particularly relevant as healthcare increasingly relies on data-driven insights.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers could save time and resources, allowing them to focus on analysis rather than data extraction.",
    "This development could signal a shift towards more automated processes in healthcare, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error."

    "eli12": "This new system uses advanced AI to pull important information from messy patient records, much like a librarian organizing a chaotic library. By automating this process, healthcare professionals could spend less time sifting through data and more time helping patients. This matters because better data can lead to improved treatments and outcomes for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a growing user need for efficient data handling in healthcare. By automating data extraction, companies could reduce costs and improve accuracy in clinical research. A practical implication is that products leveraging this technology could attract healthcare institutions looking to enhance their research capabilities.",
    "engineer": "The framework integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with structured response methods from LLMs, achieving high accuracy in identifying medical characteristics from patient notes. It operates on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, ensuring data security and privacy. This approach not only automates data extraction but also reveals annotation errors that manual reviews often miss, showcasing the potential of LLMs in clinical settings."
