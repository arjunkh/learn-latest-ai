    "eli12": "Transformers are like a smart librarian that understands the context of books on a shelf. Instead of just knowing where each book is, they grasp how the themes connect. This matters because it allows anyone, even those without a tech background, to use AI tools effectively in their everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means that integrating AI into familiar platforms like Excel could meet user needs more efficiently. It reduces the learning curve and increases adoption rates, as users can leverage powerful tools without extensive training. This could lead to innovative applications in various industries.",
    "engineer": "Transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to create contextual word representations, enhancing the understanding of text data. By converting static embeddings into dynamic ones, they improve performance on tasks like sentiment analysis or translation. This approach could outperform traditional models, especially in nuanced language understanding."
