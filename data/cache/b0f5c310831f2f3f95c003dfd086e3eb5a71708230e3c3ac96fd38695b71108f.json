    "eli12": "Think of a recommender system like a smart friend who knows your tastes. By using a billion parameters, it's like giving that friend a bigger brain, allowing them to remember more about what you like. This could help you find movies or products that fit your preferences better, making your online experience smoother and more enjoyable.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this advancement means a potential leap in user engagement through more relevant recommendations. By investing in larger models, companies could see improved retention rates as users find what they need faster. It may also lead to higher conversion rates, as personalized suggestions could drive more purchases.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, scaling transformer recommenders to a billion parameters could enhance their ability to understand user behavior patterns. This might involve utilizing advanced architectures and training techniques to manage the increased complexity. However, engineers must also consider the computational costs and efficiency of deploying such large models in real-time applications."
