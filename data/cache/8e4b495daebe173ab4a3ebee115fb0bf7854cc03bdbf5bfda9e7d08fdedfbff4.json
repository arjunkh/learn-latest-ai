    "eli12": "The article explains a new way to make AI-generated images look better by changing how colors are processed. Think of it like switching from a basic paint set to a professional palette that allows for richer and more accurate colors. This matters because it could help artists and creators produce higher-quality visuals more easily.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this innovation could enhance user experience by delivering more visually appealing AI-generated content. It may also reduce the time and cost associated with manual color correction. As a practical implication, incorporating this method could improve customer satisfaction and retention.",
    "engineer": "The article introduces a multi-tier approach that utilizes segmentation and color correction in Lab color space, which is more perceptually uniform than RGB. This method could significantly reduce color artifacts, leading to images that better match real-world colors. However, the technical challenges of implementing this system efficiently in AI models remain an important consideration."
