  "speedrun": "In software development, teams are moving quickly, which can lead to security gaps if not addressed. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) helps identify these vulnerabilities, but manual scans are often slow and cumbersome. Automating DAST tools can enhance efficiency and speed up the security process. This is crucial now as the demand for rapid development continues to grow, making security a top priority.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers need faster security checks to keep up with rapid coding, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in applications.",
    "The trend toward automation in security testing reflects a broader shift in the industry, focusing on integrating security seamlessly into the development process."

    "eli12": "As software development speeds up, security checks can't lag behind. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) helps find flaws in running apps, but doing it manually can take a lot of time. Automating this process is like having a robot helper that spots problems quickly, allowing developers to deliver safer software faster. This matters because everyone uses software daily, and better security means safer experiences online.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, automating DAST tools addresses a crucial user need: fast and reliable security checks. This efficiency can reduce costs associated with security breaches and improve overall product quality. A practical implication is that teams can integrate security testing into their workflows without sacrificing speed, enhancing both user trust and market competitiveness.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, automating DAST tools can significantly reduce the time required for security scans, allowing for continuous testing throughout the development cycle. By integrating these tools into CI/CD pipelines, teams can identify vulnerabilities earlier. This approach not only speeds up the process but also ensures that security is maintained without slowing down development, which is essential in today's fast-paced software environment."
