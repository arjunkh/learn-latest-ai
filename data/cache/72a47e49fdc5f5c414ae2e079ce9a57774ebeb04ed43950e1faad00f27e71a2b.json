  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.21419v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a refined approach to three-way conflict analysis by separating alliance and conflict functions. Traditionally, these aspects were combined, making it hard to interpret relationships between agents and issues. The study suggests that treating alliances and conflicts as distinct can lead to clearer insights. This matters now as it could enhance our understanding of complex social dynamics, informing decision-making in various fields.",

    "eli12": "This study looks at how people and issues relate in conflicts. By separating alliances from conflicts, it’s like sorting apples from oranges—each has its own characteristics. This clarity could help everyone from negotiators to everyday people understand conflicts better, leading to more effective solutions.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a new way to analyze user relationships and conflicts. By distinguishing between alliances and conflicts, teams could better address user needs and enhance product strategies. This could lead to improved user engagement and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The study proposes a model that trisects agents, issues, and agent pairs, allowing for a clearer analysis of alliances and conflicts. By separating these functions, it addresses challenges in interpreting aggregated data, such as when averaging relationships. This could improve the accuracy of conflict analysis models, which is crucial for applications in social dynamics."
