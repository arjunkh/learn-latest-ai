  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.23373v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adverse media screening is a critical component of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance processes in financial institutions. Traditional approaches rely on keyword-based searches that generate high false-positive rates or require extensive manual review. We present an agentic system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. Our system implements a multi-step approach where an LLM agent searches the web, retrieves and processes relevant documents, and computes an Adverse Media Index (AMI) score for each subject. We evaluate our approach using multiple LLM backends on a dataset comprising Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), persons from regulatory watchlists, and sanctioned persons from OpenSanctions and clean names from academic sources, demonstrating the system's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk individuals.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework has been developed for adverse media screening in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This system automates the process, significantly reducing the high false-positive rates seen in traditional keyword-based methods. It calculates an Adverse Media Index (AMI) score to evaluate risk levels of individuals. This innovation could streamline compliance efforts in financial institutions, making them more efficient and accurate.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Financial institutions could see immediate benefits from reduced manual review time and improved accuracy in identifying high-risk individuals.",
    "This development reflects a broader shift towards automation in compliance processes, potentially reshaping how AML and KYC tasks are approached across the industry."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to find a needle in a haystack using just a magnet. Traditional methods for spotting risky individuals in finance can be similarly inefficient. The new system uses advanced language models to sift through information and pinpoint risks more accurately. This matters because it could make financial transactions safer for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this new framework addresses a critical user need: efficient compliance with AML regulations. By automating adverse media screening, it could lower costs and improve accuracy in identifying risks. This means products can be developed with less manual oversight, allowing teams to focus on innovation.",
    "engineer": "The proposed system leverages LLMs combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. It evaluates subjects using an Adverse Media Index (AMI) score, which assesses risk levels based on data from various sources. This approach demonstrates improved accuracy in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk individuals compared to traditional keyword-based methods."
