  "speedrun": "In September 2025, Power BI introduced a new user-defined function (UDF) feature, enhancing its analytical capabilities. This allows users to create custom functions tailored to their data needs. The real-world application of this feature demonstrates its potential to streamline complex calculations. This development is significant as it empowers users to personalize their data analysis, making it more efficient and relevant.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Users can now customize functions to fit specific data scenarios, streamlining their workflow and improving efficiency.",
    "This feature reflects a broader trend in data tools towards greater user empowerment and customization in analytics."

    "eli12": "Power BI's new user-defined function feature lets users create their own functions for data analysis. Think of it like having a customizable recipe in cookingâ€”you can adjust ingredients to suit your taste. This matters to everyday people because it makes data analysis more accessible and tailored to individual needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the UDF feature in Power BI addresses a key user need for customization in data analysis. It could reduce costs related to complex data tasks by allowing users to automate specific calculations. This means teams can focus on insights rather than getting bogged down by repetitive tasks.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the introduction of user-defined functions in Power BI allows for more sophisticated data manipulation using DAX. This feature enables users to define custom logic and calculations that can be reused across reports. It enhances the flexibility of data models but requires careful implementation to ensure performance remains optimal."
