  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.09782v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a geometric framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) reason within their representation space. It proposes that LLM reasoning can be seen as smooth flows, with logical statements guiding these flows' velocities. This approach allows researchers to visually and quantitatively analyze LLM reasoning, providing insights into the internal logic of these models. Understanding this could enhance our interpretability of LLMs and their decision-making processes.",
