  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.07040v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.\n  We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.\n  Aster is accessible via a web interface and API at asterlab.ai.",

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Aster is like having a super-fast assistant for scientific research. It helps improve programs quickly, making discoveries possible that would take much longer otherwise. This matters because it could help researchers find solutions to important problems faster, benefiting everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Aster represents an opportunity to enhance research and development processes. By meeting user needs for faster results, it could reduce costs associated with lengthy evaluations. This efficiency might allow teams to innovate more rapidly.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Aster operates by iteratively refining programs with a focus on reducing the number of required iterations for discovery. It has been tested across various domains, achieving state-of-the-art results while using less than 1/190th of the compute in some cases. This efficiency could significantly impact how engineers approach complex problem-solving."
