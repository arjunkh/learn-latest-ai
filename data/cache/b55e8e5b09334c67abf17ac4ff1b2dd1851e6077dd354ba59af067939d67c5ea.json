    "eli12": "Machine learning is moving from being just a research tool to something that businesses use every day. Think of it like baking a cake; it’s not enough to have the recipe—you need to know how to bake it properly. This shift matters because it means more reliable AI tools will be available, improving everyday tasks for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift signifies the importance of building AI solutions that can work reliably in the real world. Users expect tools that not only function well but also adapt to changing conditions. A practical implication is that investing in robust deployment strategies could enhance user satisfaction and retention.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, deploying machine learning models involves addressing challenges like model monitoring and data drift. Engineers must ensure that models maintain performance across various scenarios, which requires continuous testing and updates. Understanding these aspects is vital for creating systems that can adapt and perform reliably in production."
