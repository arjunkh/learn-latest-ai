    "eli12": "Gradient Boosted Linear Regression is like stacking several small building blocks to create a tall tower. Each block represents a simple model, and together, they form a strong prediction tool. This method is important because it allows everyday users to make better data-driven decisions using tools they already know.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this technique highlights the need for user-friendly data tools that enhance decision-making. By integrating advanced analytics into familiar platforms like Excel, companies could reduce training costs and improve efficiency. This could lead to quicker insights and better product strategies.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Gradient Boosted Linear Regression combines weak learners to minimize prediction error. It typically utilizes decision trees as base learners, optimizing them iteratively to improve performance. While effective, users should be aware of potential overfitting if not properly tuned."
