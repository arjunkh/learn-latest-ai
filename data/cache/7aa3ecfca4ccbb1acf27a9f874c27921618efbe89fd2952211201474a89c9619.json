  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.03359v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new workflow to improve how Large Language Models (LLMs) follow instructions. By separating the main task description from specific constraints, they can optimize prompts more effectively. This method showed that models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B achieved significantly higher compliance scores. This innovation could enhance the reliability of LLM outputs, making them more useful in practical applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This method could directly benefit developers and researchers who rely on precise LLM outputs for applications in various fields.",
    "It signals a shift in AI development towards more nuanced approaches that prioritize both content relevance and procedural accuracy."

    "eli12": "Imagine teaching a student not just what to write but also how to format it correctly. This new workflow helps LLMs understand both the content and the rules for presenting it. It matters because clearer instructions could lead to better, more reliable AI-generated content for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this new approach could improve user satisfaction by ensuring AI tools produce outputs that are not only relevant but also adhere to necessary guidelines. This could lead to reduced revision costs and enhance overall efficiency in product development.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this method uses quantitative feedback to refine prompt instructions for LLMs. The evaluation revealed that models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B showed significantly improved compliance scores, indicating a successful decoupling of task descriptions from constraints, which could enhance model performance in diverse applications."
