    "eli12": "In simple terms, the success of AI projects depends on having good data. Think of data quality like the ingredients in a recipe; without the right ones, even the best chef can’t create a delicious dish. For everyday people, this means that the AI tools they use will work better and deliver more accurate results if companies focus on improving their data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding that data quality impacts AI project success is vital. Ensuring high-quality data can lead to more efficient AI solutions, ultimately saving time and costs. This means that when developing new features or products, prioritizing data management could enhance user experience and drive revenue.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the dependency on data quality is crucial for AI model performance. If data is unreliable, even the most advanced algorithms might fail to deliver accurate predictions. Companies must focus on data validation and cleansing processes to ensure that their AI systems can operate effectively, which is essential for achieving meaningful outcomes."
