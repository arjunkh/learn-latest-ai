  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.20694v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.",

  "speedrun": "A new dataset called Reasoning With a Star has been introduced to enhance scientific reasoning in heliophysics using Large Language Models. It includes structured question-and-answer formats derived from NASA and UCAR problem sets, focusing on physical assumptions and consistent units. Initial benchmarks show that a systems engineering approach, which breaks down workflows, performs better than traditional prompting methods. This is important as it could improve how AI assists in scientific research and education.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and educators in heliophysics could benefit from improved AI tools that enhance scientific reasoning and accuracy in educational contexts.",
    "This development indicates a broader shift towards using structured datasets and engineering principles in training AI, potentially improving outcomes across various scientific fields."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The Reasoning With a Star dataset helps AI understand complex scientific problems better. It’s like giving a student a well-organized textbook instead of just random notes. This matters because it could make learning about space and science more effective for everyone, especially students.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this dataset offers a way to create AI tools that are more effective in scientific contexts. By focusing on structured reasoning, these tools could meet user needs for accuracy and understanding, potentially reducing development costs and improving user engagement.",
    "engineer": "The dataset employs a programmatic grading system that checks predictions for unit consistency and logical structure. Initial benchmarks reveal that a systems engineering approach outperforms traditional methods in deductive reasoning tasks. This suggests that incorporating such structured methodologies could enhance AI performance in complex reasoning scenarios."
