  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.15966v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced PISA, a new memory system for AI that enhances adaptability and task-oriented memory. Inspired by Piaget's cognitive development theory, it employs a trimodal adaptation mechanism for continuous learning. PISA also integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, improving accuracy and efficiency. This matters now as it sets a new standard for AI memory systems, potentially transforming how AI learns and retains knowledge over time.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "PISA could significantly enhance AI performance in diverse applications, benefiting developers and users by providing smarter, more adaptable systems.",
    "The introduction of PISA signals a shift in AI design towards more human-like memory processes, which could lead to more effective and versatile AI agents across various industries."

    "eli12": "PISA is like giving AI a better filing system for its memories, allowing it to adapt and learn continuously. By using ideas from how humans learn, it helps AI remember things more effectively. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to smarter tools that understand and respond to our needs more accurately.",
    "pm": "For product managers, PISA represents a way to build AI systems that learn and adapt over time, enhancing user experience. The trimodal adaptation mechanism could lower costs by improving efficiency in memory usage. This means products could become more responsive and intelligent, meeting user needs more effectively.",
    "engineer": "PISA introduces a hybrid memory access architecture that combines symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, enhancing retrieval accuracy. Its trimodal adaptation mechanism—schema updation, evolution, and creation—ensures that memory remains organized while allowing for flexible updates. This approach sets a new benchmark in adaptability and long-term knowledge retention, outperforming existing systems on the LOCOMO and AggQA benchmarks."
