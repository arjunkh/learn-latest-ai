  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.21827v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explores how to effectively generate synthetic clinical notes for multimodal AI in healthcare. It highlights that combining images and text can improve model performance, particularly in dermatology, where data is often limited. The research shows that well-designed prompts and medical metadata can enhance classification accuracy and cross-modal retrieval capabilities. As healthcare increasingly relies on AI, these findings could significantly advance the reliability of medical applications.",

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI can better understand patient information by combining images and text. Think of it like a puzzle where each piece—like a photo of a skin lesion and a description—makes the picture clearer. By improving how these pieces fit together, doctors could get more accurate insights into patient health, which matters for better care.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a user need for more comprehensive AI tools that integrate different types of data. By leveraging synthetic clinical notes, products could enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This could lead to better user experiences and potentially lower costs in developing AI solutions for healthcare.",
    "engineer": "The study focuses on the use of synthetic clinical notes to improve multimodal AI models in dermatology. It emphasizes the importance of prompt design and medical metadata, showing that these factors can enhance classification performance by addressing domain shifts. The findings suggest that integrating textual data with image data significantly improves cross-modal retrieval, a key area for future AI applications."
