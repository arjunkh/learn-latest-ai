  "raw_body": "OpenAI has officially released GPT-5.2, and the reactions from early testers — among whom OpenAI seeded the model several days prior to public release, in some cases weeks ago — paints a two toned picture: it is a monumental leap forward for deep, autonomous reasoning and coding, yet potentially an underwhelming \"incremental\" update for casual conversationalists.\nFollowing early access periods and today's broader rollout, executives, developers, and analysts have taken to X (formerly Twitter) and company blogs to share their first testing results. \nHere is a roundup of the first reactions to OpenAI’s latest flagship model.\n\"AI as a serious analyst\"\nThe strongest praise for GPT-5.2 centers on its ability to handle \"hard problems\" that require extended thinking time.\nMatt Shumer, CEO of HyperWriteAI, did not mince words in his review, calling GPT-5.2 Pro \"the best model in the world.\" \nShumer highlighted the model's tenacity, noting that \"it thinks for **over an hour** on hard problems. And it nails tasks no other model can touch.\"\nThis sentiment was echoed by Allie K. Miller, an AI entrepreneur and former AWS executive. Miller described the model as a step toward \"AI as a serious analyst\" rather than a \"friendly companion.\"\n\"The thinking and problem-solving feel noticeably stronger,\" Miller wrote on X. \"It gives much deeper explanations than I’m used to seeing. At one point it literally wrote code to improve its own OCR in the middle of a task.\"\nEnterprise gains: Box reports distinct performance jumps\nFor the enterprise sector, the update appears to be even more significant. \nAaron Levie, CEO of Box, revealed on X that his company has been testing GPT-5.2 in early access. Levie reported that the model performs \"7 points better than GPT-5.1\" on their expanded reasoning tests, which approximate real-world knowledge work in financial services and life sciences.\n\"The model performed the majority of the tasks far faster than GPT-5.1 and GPT-5 as well,\" Levie noted, confirming that Box AI will be rolling out GPT-5.2 integration shortly.\nRutuja Rajwade, a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Box, expanded on this in a company blog post, citing specific latency improvements. \n\"Complex extraction\" tasks dropped from 46 seconds on GPT-5 to just 12 seconds with GPT-5.2. \nRajwade also noted a jump in reasoning capabilities for the Media and Entertainment vertical, rising from 76% accuracy in GPT-5.1 to 81% in the new model.\nA \"serious leap\" for coding and simulation\nDevelopers are finding GPT-5.2 particularly potent for \"one-shot\" generation of complex code structures.\nPietro Schirano, CEO of magicpathai, shared a video of the model building a full 3D graphics engine in a single file with interactive controls. \"It’s a serious leap forward in complex reasoning, math, coding, and simulations,\" Schirano posted. \"The pace of progress is unreal.\"\n\nSimilarly, Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and longtime LLM and AI power user and writer, demonstrated the model's ability to create a visually complex shader—an infinite neo-gothic city in a stormy ocean—via a single prompt.\nThe Agentic Era: Long-running autonomy\nPerhaps the most functional shift is the model's ability to stay on task for hours without losing the thread.\nDan Shipper, CEO of thoughtful AI testing newsletter Every, reported that the model successfully performed a profit and loss (P&L) analysis that required it to work autonomously for two hours. \"It did a P&L analysis where it worked for 2 hours and gave me great results,\" Shipper wrote.\nHowever, Shipper also noted that for day-to-day tasks, the update feels \"mostly incremental.\" \nIn an article for Every, Katie Parrott wrote that while GPT-5.2 excels at instruction following, it is \"less resourceful\" than competitors like Claude Opus 4.5 in certain contexts, such as deducing a user's location from email data.\nThe downsides: Speed and Rigidity\nDespite the reasoning capabilities, the \"feel\" of the model has drawn critique.\nShumer highlighted a significant \"speed penalty\" when using the model's Thinking mode. \"In my experience the Thinking mode is very slow for most questions,\" Shumer wrote in his deep-dive review. \"I almost never use Instant.\"\nAllie Miller also pointed out issues with the model's default behavior. \"The downside is tone and format,\" she noted. \"The default voice felt a bit more rigid, and the length/markdown behavior is extreme: a simple question turned into 58 bullets and numbered points.\"\nThe Verdict\nThe early reaction suggests that GPT-5.2 is a tool optimized for power users, developers, and enterprise agents rather than casual chat. As Shumer summarized in his review: \"For deep research, complex reasoning, and tasks that benefit from careful thought, GPT-5.2 Pro is the best option available right now.\"\nHowever, for users seeking creative writing or quick, fluid answers, models like Claude Opus 4.5 remain strong competitors. \"My favorite model remains Claude Opus 4.5,\" Miller admitted, \"but my complex ChatGPT work will get a nice incremental boost.\"",

  "speedrun": "OpenAI has released GPT-5.2, which early testers describe as a significant advancement for deep reasoning and coding tasks, but less impressive for casual conversations. Notably, the model outperformed GPT-5.1 by 7 points in reasoning tests and reduced task completion time from 46 seconds to just 12 seconds for complex extractions. This update matters now because it could reshape how businesses approach AI for complex problem-solving and coding tasks.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses could benefit from enhanced efficiency in complex tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-level strategies and decisions.",
    "The broader market may shift towards prioritizing AI models that excel in analytical and coding capabilities, potentially sidelining those focused on casual interactions."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "GPT-5.2 is like a supercharged calculator for complex problems, capable of thinking for long periods to find answers. While it excels in deep reasoning, it might not be the best choice for casual chats. This matters because people and businesses can use it to solve tough issues more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, GPT-5.2 represents a shift towards AI that can handle complex tasks efficiently, meeting user needs for deep analysis. The reduced time for tasks could lead to cost savings and improved productivity. It may also encourage teams to leverage AI for more intricate projects rather than casual engagement.",
    "engineer": "Technically, GPT-5.2 shows a 7-point improvement over GPT-5.1 in reasoning tests and can complete complex extraction tasks in just 12 seconds. The model's ability to maintain focus for hours on tasks like profit and loss analysis highlights its advanced capabilities in coding and reasoning. However, some users noted a speed penalty in its Thinking mode, which could impact usability in certain scenarios."
