This paper presents a unified framework that integrates instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) with ontology-aligned Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable intent-driven interaction in Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystems. We fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct-V02 on a domain-specific dataset, enabling the translation of natural language intents into structured JSON requirement models. These models are semantically mapped to a Neo4j-based knowledge graph grounded in the ISA-95 standard, ensuring operational alignment with manufacturing processes, resources, and constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over zero-shot and 3-shots baselines, achieving 89.33\\% exact match accuracy and 97.27\\% overall accuracy. This work lays the foundation for scalable, explainable, and adaptive human-machine",

    "eli12": "Imagine asking a factory robot to 'make more of product X' and it instantly knows how to do it. This new framework allows machines to understand human commands better, using advanced AI models. It matters because it could make factories smarter and more responsive to what people really want.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this framework highlights a growing user need for seamless human-machine communication in manufacturing. By leveraging LLMs and KGs, companies could reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. A practical takeaway is that integrating such technologies could enhance user experience and adaptability in production lines.",
    "engineer": "The framework merges instruction-tuned LLMs like Mistral-7B-Instruct-V02 with ontology-aligned KGs, achieving 89.33% exact match accuracy. This setup uses a Neo4j-based knowledge graph aligned with ISA-95 standards, ensuring accurate mapping of intents to manufacturing processes. While the results are promising, ongoing evaluation against more complex scenarios could further validate its effectiveness."
