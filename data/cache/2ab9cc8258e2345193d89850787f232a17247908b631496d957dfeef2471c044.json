  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.05324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced the Perception Graph, a new model aimed at enhancing augmented reality (AR) systems' resilience against cognitive attacks. These attacks can distort a user's perception, leading to poor decision-making in critical situations. The Perception Graph mimics human interpretation of information and quantifies perception distortion, providing a measurable way to detect these vulnerabilities. This development is crucial as AR technology becomes more prevalent in tactical environments, where clear decision-making is vital.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This model could significantly improve safety for military personnel and first responders using AR in high-stakes scenarios.",
    "The introduction of the Perception Graph signals a shift towards more secure AR technologies, reflecting growing concerns about user manipulation in digital environments."

    "eli12": "The Perception Graph is like a safety net for augmented reality users, helping to protect them from misleading information. By analyzing how we perceive data in AR, it offers a way to spot when things are off. This matters because as AR becomes part of everyday life, ensuring clear and accurate information is essential for making good decisions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the Perception Graph highlights a crucial user need: ensuring reliable information in AR applications. It can enhance user trust and safety, which are key factors in adoption. Implementing this model could lead to more efficient decision-making tools in AR, directly impacting user experience and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The Perception Graph employs a structured approach to model human perception in augmented reality, mimicking human cognitive processes. It quantifies perception distortion with a score, allowing for precise detection of cognitive attacks. This model could improve the robustness of AR systems, but engineers should consider the complexities of integrating such a nuanced framework into existing technologies."
