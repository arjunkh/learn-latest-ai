  "speedrun": "Evelyn Wang, a graduate from 2000, recalls her childhood in Los Angeles during severe water shortages. She vividly remembers strict water usage rules, such as not using sprinklers and receiving disinfectant tablets for toilets. This early experience shaped her understanding of water conservation. Today, her insights could lead to innovative solutions for sustainable water management in drought-prone areas.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Communities facing water scarcity could benefit from new conservation technologies developed from these experiences.",
    "This reflects a broader trend toward sustainable practices in response to climate challenges, influencing how resources are managed globally."

    "eli12": "Evelyn Wang's childhood memories highlight the real impact of water shortages. Imagine living in a place where you can't water your garden or even flush your toilet without a special tablet. Her experiences remind us that conserving water is essential, especially as climate change intensifies these issues. This matters to everyone, as water is a vital resource for daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Wang's story underscores the importance of developing solutions that address water scarcity. Users increasingly seek efficient water management tools that can help them conserve resources. This could lead to new market opportunities for products designed to optimize water use and promote sustainability.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Wang's insights could inspire new engineering approaches to water conservation. Solutions might involve smart irrigation systems or water recycling technologies. These innovations could significantly improve efficiency in water use, especially in regions prone to drought, highlighting the need for advanced engineering in resource management."
