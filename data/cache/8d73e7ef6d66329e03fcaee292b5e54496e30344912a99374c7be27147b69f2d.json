  "speedrun": "As artificial intelligence adoption surges in the Asia Pacific, data centres are under increasing pressure to adapt. Traditional facilities, designed for older computing needs, are struggling with the high energy and cooling demands of AI systems. By 2030, GPU-driven workloads could significantly increase rack power densities. This shift matters now because it highlights the urgent need for infrastructure upgrades to support evolving technology.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data centres must innovate to meet the energy and cooling needs of AI, impacting companies relying on these facilities for operations.",
    "This trend reflects a broader shift in the tech landscape, indicating that infrastructure must evolve to support advanced computing demands."

    "eli12": "The rise of AI in Asia Pacific is pushing data centres to change how they operate. Think of it like upgrading a car engine to handle more power; the old facilities can't keep up. This matters to everyday people because it affects how quickly and efficiently companies can use AI to improve services and products.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend signals a critical user need for reliable data infrastructure. As AI applications grow, ensuring that data centres can handle increased demands could enhance service efficiency. This could lead to higher operational costs if facilities don't adapt in time.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, traditional data centres are ill-equipped for the GPU-driven workloads expected by 2030, which could push rack power densities significantly higher. Adapting infrastructure will require innovations in energy management and cooling systems. Engineers need to consider these demands when designing future data centre solutions."
