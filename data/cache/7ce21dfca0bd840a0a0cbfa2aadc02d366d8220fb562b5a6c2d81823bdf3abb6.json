  "speedrun": "Large language models (LLMs) have millions or even billions of parameters, which are essentially the building blocks that help the model understand and generate language. These parameters adjust based on the data the model processes, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships within the language. Understanding parameters is crucial as it highlights how LLMs function and their potential limitations. This knowledge is particularly relevant now as the use of LLMs expands across various industries.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For developers and researchers, grasping parameters can enhance model performance and efficiency, leading to improved applications.",
    "On a broader scale, understanding parameters could influence investment and development strategies in AI, shaping future innovations."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Parameters in LLMs are like ingredients in a recipe. Just as the right mix of ingredients creates a delicious dish, the right parameters help the model understand language better. This matters because it affects how well AI can assist us in daily tasks, from writing to customer service.",
    "pm": "For product managers, knowing about parameters helps in aligning user needs with model capabilities. A model with more parameters might offer better performance but could also increase costs. Understanding this balance is key for developing efficient and user-friendly products.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, parameters in LLMs can number in the billions, significantly impacting the model's ability to capture language nuances. For instance, OpenAI's GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, showcasing the scale at which these models operate. However, more parameters require greater computational resources, which can be a limiting factor in model deployment."
