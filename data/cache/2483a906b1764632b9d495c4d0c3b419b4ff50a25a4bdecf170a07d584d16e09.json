    "eli12": "Sunday Robotics has created Memo, a robot that learns from how people actually behave instead of just computer simulations. Imagine teaching a child by letting them observe and participate in daily life. This could make Memo more helpful and flexible around the house, which is great for families needing a little extra support.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Memo represents a shift in user-centered design for household robots. By focusing on real human interactions, it addresses the need for more relatable and efficient home assistants. This could influence future products to prioritize experiential learning, enhancing user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "Memo is built on a unique training model that emphasizes real human data rather than traditional simulations. This approach could improve its adaptability and performance in everyday tasks. By leveraging actual user interactions, Memo may achieve higher accuracy in understanding and responding to household needs, setting a new benchmark in robotics."
