    "eli12": "Imagine a bank using a smart assistant that handles customer questions or processes transactions. That's what AI is doing for banks, helping them work faster and better. This shift matters to everyday people because it means banks could serve customers more efficiently, but it might also change the job landscape.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this AI integration signals a need to focus on user-friendly solutions that enhance productivity. As banks reduce staff, the demand for efficient tools could rise, driving innovation. Understanding this trend could help in developing products that meet evolving market needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, generative AI models are being deployed to automate tasks across banking operations, improving efficiency benchmarks. This could lead to significant performance gains in areas such as customer service interactions and transaction processing. However, careful consideration of implementation challenges remains important."
