    "eli12": "This article helps explain how companies can manage the risks associated with AI systems. Instead of just setting rules, businesses should create clear boundaries for AI actions. Think of it like teaching a dog—it's not just about commands but also about knowing where the dog can roam safely. This matters because it can help keep our data and privacy secure.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this article emphasizes the need for robust governance frameworks in AI products. Understanding agent risk can help teams design features that prioritize user safety and data integrity. By focusing on boundaries rather than just prompts, companies could enhance efficiency and reduce potential legal issues.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article highlights the importance of establishing operational boundaries for AI systems to prevent unauthorized actions. This approach goes beyond traditional prompt-based controls, indicating a shift towards more sophisticated governance models. Implementing these strategies could involve developing new algorithms that enforce these boundaries effectively."
