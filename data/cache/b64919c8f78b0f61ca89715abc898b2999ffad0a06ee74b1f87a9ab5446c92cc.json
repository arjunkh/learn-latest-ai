  "raw_body": "Enterprises that want tokenizer-free multilingual models are increasingly turning to byte-level language models to reduce brittleness in noisy or low-resource text. To tap into that niche — and make it practical at scale — the Allen Institute of AI (Ai2) introduced Bolmo, a new family of models that leverage its Olmo 3 models by “bytefiying” them and reusing their backbone and capabilities. \nThe company launched two versions, Bolmo 7B and Bolmo 1B, which are “the first fully open byte-level language model,” according to Ai2. The company said the two models performed competitively with — and in some cases surpassed — other byte-level and character-based models.\n\nByte-level language models operate directly on raw UTF-8 bytes, eliminating the need for a predefined vocabulary or tokenizer. This allows them to handle misspellings, rare languages, and unconventional text more reliably — key requirements for moderation, edge deployments, and multilingual applications.\nFor enterprises deploying AI across multiple languages, noisy user inputs, or constrained environments, tokenizer-free models offer a way to reduce operational complexity. Ai2’s Bolmo is an attempt to make that approach practical at scale — without retraining from scratch.\nHow Bolmo works and how it was built \nAi2 said it trained the Bolmo models using its Dolma 3 data mix, which helped train its Olmo flagship models, and some open code datasets and character-level data.\nThe company said its goal “is to provide a reproducible, inspectable blueprint for byteifying strong subword language models in a way the community can adopt and extend.” To meet this goal, Ai2 will release its checkpoints, code, and a full paper to help other organizations build byte-level models on top of its Olmo ecosystem. \nSince training a byte-level model completely from scratch can get expensive, Ai2 researchers instead chose an existing Olmo 3 7B checkpoint to byteify in two stages. \nIn the first stage, Ai2 froze the Olmo 3 transformer so that they only train certain parts, such as the local encoder and decoder, the boundary predictor, and the language modeling head. This was designed to be “cheap and fast” and requires just 9.8 billion tokens. \nThe next stage unfreezes the model and trains it with additional tokens. Ai2 said the byte-level approach allows Bolmo to avoid the vocabulary bottlenecks that limit traditional subword models.\nStrong performance among its peers\nByte-level language models are not as mainstream as small language models or LLMs, but this is a growing field in research. Meta released its BLT architecture research last year, aiming to offer a model that is robust, processes raw data, and doesn’t rely on fixed vocabularies. \nOther research models in this space include ByT5, Stanford’s MrT5, and Canine.  \nAi2 evaluated Bolmo using its evaluation suite, covering math, STEM reasoning, question answering, general knowledge, and code. \nBolmo 7B showed strong performance, outperforming character-focused benchmarks like CUTE and EXECUTE, and also improving accuracy over the base LLM Olmo 3. \nBolmo 7B outperformed models of comparable size in coding, math, multiple-choice QA, and character-level understanding. \nWhy enterprises may choose byte-level models\nEnterprises find value in a hybrid model structure, using a mix of models and model sizes. \nAi2 makes the case that organizations should also consider byte-level models not only for robustness and multilingual understanding, but because it “naturally plugs into an existing model ecosystem.”\n“A key advantage of the dynamic hierarchical setup is that compression becomes a toggleable knob,” the company said. \nFor enterprises already running heterogeneous model stacks, Bolmo suggests that byte-level models may no longer be purely academic. By retrofitting a strong subword model rather than training from scratch, Ai2 is signaling a lower-risk path for organizations that want robustness without abandoning existing infrastructure.",

  "speedrun": "The Allen Institute of AI (Ai2) has launched Bolmo, a new family of byte-level language models designed for multilingual applications. Bolmo comes in two versions, 7B and 1B, and is claimed to be the first fully open byte-level model, outperforming some existing models in various tasks. This innovation allows enterprises to handle noisy text and rare languages without the need for tokenizers, making it easier to deploy AI at scale. The introduction of Bolmo could shift how organizations approach language models in diverse environments.",

    "eli12": "Bolmo is a new kind of language model that works directly with raw text data, making it more flexible for different languages and messy inputs. Think of it like a universal remote that can control any device without needing specific buttons for each one. This matters because it simplifies how companies can use AI to understand and interact with diverse user inputs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Bolmo offers a way to enhance user experience by improving AI's understanding of various languages and text types. By reducing reliance on tokenizers, it could lower costs associated with model training and maintenance. This practical approach could make AI more accessible for businesses operating in multilingual environments.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Bolmo utilizes a two-stage training process that builds on the existing Olmo 3 model, requiring only 9.8 billion tokens in the initial phase. This byte-level approach allows it to bypass the vocabulary limitations of traditional models, achieving strong performance in tasks like coding and math. Bolmo 7B notably outperformed character-focused benchmarks, showcasing the potential of byte-level architectures in practical applications."
