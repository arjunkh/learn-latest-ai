  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.18391v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science, and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO demonstrates a 12\\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining, the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints into preference learning.",
