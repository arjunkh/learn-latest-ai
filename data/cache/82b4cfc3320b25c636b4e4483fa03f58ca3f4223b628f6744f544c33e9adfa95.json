    "eli12": "In 2025, many workplaces still deal with a messy mix of document types, making it hard to find and use information quickly. Imagine trying to bake a cake with ingredients scattered all over the kitchen; it takes longer to create something delicious. For everyday people, this means more frustration and wasted time when trying to access important documents.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the ongoing struggle with document formats presents a clear user need for better tools. Improving document management could lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs for businesses. A practical implication is that investing in solutions like Docling could enhance team productivity significantly.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the challenge lies in integrating various document formats into a cohesive system. Current tools may not effectively parse or convert data from PDFs or scanned images, leading to inefficiencies. Addressing these issues could involve developing more advanced algorithms or machine learning models capable of handling diverse document types."
