    "eli12": "Feather is a software that helps older graphics cards work better for deep learning. Imagine if your old car could run on a new type of fuel that makes it faster without needing a new engine. This matters because it helps more people use powerful AI tools without spending a lot of money.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this software solution addresses the user need for efficient deep learning without high costs. It allows teams to maximize their existing resources, potentially leading to faster product development cycles. By improving performance on older hardware, companies could better allocate budgets and focus on innovation.",
    "engineer": "Feather's software-based FP8 emulation uses bitwise packing to enhance memory bandwidth for older GPUs. It achieves a 3.3x bandwidth improvement, approaching the theoretical maximum of 4x. This approach allows engineers to leverage existing hardware capabilities, potentially extending the lifespan and utility of older GPU models in deep learning applications."
