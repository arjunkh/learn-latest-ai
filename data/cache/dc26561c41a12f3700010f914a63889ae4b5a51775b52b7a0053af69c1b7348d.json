    "eli12": "A small company in Maine is using nature to help fight climate change and just got a big boost of $50 million to do it. Imagine planting trees or restoring wetlands, which naturally absorb carbon dioxide. This is important because it shows how we can work with nature to make our planet healthier.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this funding indicates a growing market for sustainable solutions that meet user demand for eco-friendly practices. Investing in nature-based technologies could lower costs and improve efficiency in carbon management. This trend suggests that aligning products with environmental goals could attract more customers.",
    "engineer": "The aquaculture company plans to leverage natural carbon removal processes, potentially using models that mimic ecosystems like mangroves or seagrasses. These systems can sequester significant amounts of CO2, offering a scalable approach to carbon management. However, the effectiveness of these methods can vary based on local conditions and implementation strategies."
