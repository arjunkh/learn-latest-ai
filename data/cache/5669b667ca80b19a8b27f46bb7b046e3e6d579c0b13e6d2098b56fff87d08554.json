  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from \"LLM + tool use\" to \"LLM + skill acquisition\". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced CASCADE, a self-evolving framework for large language model (LLM) agents that shifts their capabilities from just tool use to acquiring skills. By leveraging continuous learning and self-reflection, CASCADE achieved a remarkable 93.3% success rate on complex scientific tasks, compared to only 35.4% without these mechanisms. This advancement could significantly enhance AI's role in scientific research, allowing for more sophisticated and autonomous experimentation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Scientists and researchers could benefit from enhanced AI tools that adapt and evolve, improving efficiency in complex tasks.",
    "The introduction of CASCADE signals a broader shift toward more autonomous AI systems, which could redefine how scientific research is conducted."

    "eli12": "CASCADE is like giving a language model a brain that helps it learn and grow. Instead of just using tools, it can now acquire new skills by searching the web and reflecting on its knowledge. This matters because it could make AI smarter and more useful for everyday tasks, especially in science.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, CASCADE presents an opportunity to develop AI products that are not just reactive but proactive in learning. This could reduce costs related to manual tool integration and improve user experience by providing smarter, more adaptable solutions. It suggests a shift towards AI systems that continuously evolve based on user interactions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, CASCADE utilizes continuous learning and introspection to enhance LLM capabilities. It was evaluated on SciSkillBench, achieving a 93.3% success rate with GPT-5, demonstrating the effectiveness of its evolutionary mechanisms. This approach could lead to more robust models that can tackle complex scientific tasks autonomously."
