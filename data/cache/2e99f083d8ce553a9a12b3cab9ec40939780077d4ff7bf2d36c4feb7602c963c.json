  "speedrun": "Block and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are testing AI agents in financial services and drug discovery. They believe the key is to fit AI into existing processes, not change those processes for AI. This approach could streamline operations and enhance efficiency in these sectors.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For companies like Block and GSK, this means more effective integration of AI, potentially leading to significant cost savings and improved outcomes in their respective fields.",
    "On a broader scale, this strategy could set a template for other enterprises, influencing how industries adopt AI technologies and optimize workflows."

    "eli12": "Think of AI agents as new tools in a toolbox. Instead of redesigning the whole toolbox, companies like Block and GSK are finding ways to use these tools with what they already have. This approach can help everyone work smarter and faster.",
    "pm": "Product managers should focus on how AI can enhance existing workflows rather than overhauling them. This can create a competitive edge by improving efficiency and user satisfaction. A practical next step is to assess current processes and identify where AI can be seamlessly integrated.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, integrating AI agents into established processes requires careful mapping of workflows. This approach can mitigate risks associated with disruptive changes. However, it may limit the full potential of AI if existing processes are outdated or inefficient."
