    "eli12": "Databricks and Snowflake are like top athletes reaching their peak performance, but now they face tough competition that limits their growth. As they hit this ceiling, it could mean fewer updates and new features for users. This matters to everyday people who rely on these tools for data processing and insights, as it could slow down advancements in technology they depend on.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the challenges faced by Databricks and Snowflake highlight the need to innovate continuously. As these companies hit a growth ceiling, it could lead to higher costs for users if competition doesn’t drive efficiencies. This situation encourages exploring alternative solutions or enhancements that meet evolving user needs.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Databricks and Snowflake are encountering limitations in scalability and feature expansion due to market saturation. Their architectures, while robust, may struggle to adapt quickly to new demands as competitors emerge. This scenario emphasizes the importance of building flexible systems that can evolve with user needs and market trends."
