    "eli12": "Managing AI costs is like finding the right balance in cooking; too much of one ingredient can spoil the dish. The article highlights how smaller language models can still deliver great results while saving money. This is important for everyone, as it means businesses can invest in AI without breaking the bank.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding cost control in AI is essential. Streamlining model sizes and training can meet user needs efficiently while minimizing expenses. This could lead to more competitive pricing and better product offerings in the market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the article emphasizes the importance of model efficiency in LLMs. Smaller models can achieve performance close to larger counterparts with less computational power. This highlights a trend towards optimizing algorithms and architectures to manage costs effectively while maintaining performance."
