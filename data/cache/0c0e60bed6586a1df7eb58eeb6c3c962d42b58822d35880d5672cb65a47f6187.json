  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.18034v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper studies the use of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics as a computational engine for discrete facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.",

  "speedrun": "A new study explores using Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) with VSIDS heuristics to tackle discrete facility layout problems. The research shows that CDCL offers consistent runtime for feasibility detection, unlike other methods like CP-SAT and MILP, which slow down as problem complexity increases. This matters now because efficient facility layout can greatly impact operational efficiency in industries ranging from manufacturing to logistics.",

    "Businesses focused on optimizing space and resources can benefit from faster layout solutions, improving productivity and reducing costs.",
    "The findings signal a shift towards more efficient computational methods in facility planning, potentially changing how companies approach layout design."

    "eli12": "This research looks at a smart way to solve complex layout problems, like arranging factory equipment. It uses a method called CDCL that quickly finds feasible solutions without getting bogged down by complexity. This is important because it could help businesses make better use of their space and resources, leading to smoother operations.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study highlights a new approach to solving layout issues that could save time and costs. By combining CDCL with other methods, businesses can quickly identify workable layouts while still aiming for optimal solutions. This dual approach could enhance product offerings in logistics or manufacturing tools.",
    "engineer": "The paper presents a CNF-based formulation for facility layout problems and compares CDCL with CP-SAT and MILP in a unified benchmarking framework. CDCL shows near-constant runtime for feasibility detection, while CP-SAT and MILP exhibit polynomial and exponential scaling, respectively. The introduction of hybrid architectures allows for faster feasible layout enumeration and warm-start solutions, indicating a promising direction for optimizing large-scale discrete layout challenges."
