    "eli12": "Imagine using old soda cans to power your home instead of relying on fossil fuels. Found Energy is testing this idea with aluminum scraps to create zero-carbon fuel. If it works, it could help reduce pollution and make energy cleaner for everyone. This matters because it opens new possibilities for how we think about waste and energy.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Found Energy's initiative highlights a growing user demand for sustainable solutions. Utilizing aluminum scraps could lower costs and improve efficiency in energy production. This test could lead to new product opportunities in the clean energy market, addressing both environmental concerns and consumer preferences.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Found Energy aims to harness the energy stored in aluminum scraps, which could be a novel approach to zero-carbon fuels. This real-world test will provide data on efficiency and energy output compared to traditional fuels. Success here could pave the way for more research into aluminum as a viable energy source, though scalability remains a key consideration."
