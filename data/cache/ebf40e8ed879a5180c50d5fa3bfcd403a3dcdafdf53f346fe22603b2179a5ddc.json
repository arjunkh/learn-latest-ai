  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.14910v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.",

  "speedrun": "AgroAskAI is a new multi-agent AI system designed to assist smallholder farmers facing climate-related challenges like droughts and heavy rainfall. It uses a modular architecture with specialized agents that work together to provide real-time, context-aware support. Early experiments indicate that it can generate more actionable advice for farmers, particularly in vulnerable rural areas. This matters now as climate change intensifies, making effective decision support crucial for agricultural sustainability.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Smallholder farmers can receive tailored advice on climate adaptation, helping them make informed decisions to protect their livelihoods.",
    "This development signals a shift towards collaborative AI systems that can address complex, real-world problems in agriculture and beyond."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "AgroAskAI is like a team of specialized helpers, each focused on a different task to support farmers facing climate issues. Instead of just one assistant giving advice, this system uses many agents that work together to provide better solutions. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to more resilient farming practices, helping communities adapt to changing weather and secure their food supply.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, AgroAskAI highlights the importance of creating adaptive tools that meet specific user needs in agriculture. By focusing on dynamic, collaborative solutions, it could improve cost efficiency and user engagement. A practical implication is the potential for integrating real-time data to enhance decision-making, making it easier for farmers to respond to climate risks.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AgroAskAI employs a modular, role-specialized architecture that coordinates autonomous agents for dynamic reasoning. It integrates real-time tools and datasets, which enhances its ability to provide context-aware outputs. The system's governance mechanisms help reduce inaccuracies and ensure relevant strategies, showcasing the potential of agentic AI in complex decision-making environments."
