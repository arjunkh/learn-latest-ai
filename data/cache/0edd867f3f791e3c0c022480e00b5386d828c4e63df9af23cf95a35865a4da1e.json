  "speedrun": "The IEEE has published a framework aimed at establishing standards for humanoid robots. This initiative is part of a larger project to create a comprehensive roadmap for their development. By setting these standards, the IEEE hopes to ensure safety, interoperability, and effectiveness in humanoid robotics. This matters now as the industry is rapidly evolving, and clear guidelines could help foster innovation and trust.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers and manufacturers will benefit from clear guidelines, enabling safer and more effective humanoid robots. This could lead to increased adoption in various sectors.",
    "This framework reflects a broader shift toward standardization in robotics, which could streamline collaboration and accelerate advancements across the industry."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The IEEE has created a new set of guidelines for humanoid robots, similar to how traffic laws help keep roads safe. These standards will help developers build robots that work well together and are safe to use. For everyday people, this could mean better robots that assist us in daily tasks more reliably.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the IEEE's standards could clarify user needs and enhance product development. By following these guidelines, companies might reduce costs associated with safety and compliance. This could lead to faster market entry for humanoid robots, meeting user demand more efficiently.",
    "engineer": "The IEEE's framework outlines key specifications for humanoid robots, focusing on safety and interoperability. This could involve benchmarks for performance and reliability, enabling engineers to design robots that meet these criteria. However, the report emphasizes the need for continuous updates as technology evolves."
