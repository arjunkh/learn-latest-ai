    "eli12": "This article shows how to build a neural network using Excel, making it easier for anyone to understand how these systems work. Think of it like learning to bake a cake by following a recipe step-by-step, rather than just seeing the finished product. This matters because it helps everyday people grasp complex technology, which is increasingly part of our lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this approach highlights the user need for accessible AI tools. By simplifying complex concepts, they could create educational products that lower the barrier to entry for machine learning. This could lead to more innovative applications as more people understand and engage with AI.",
    "engineer": "The article outlines the construction of a neural network regressor in Excel, detailing processes like forward propagation and backpropagation. By using basic formulas, it illustrates how these networks can approximate non-linear functions efficiently. This hands-on approach could serve as a practical guide for engineers looking to teach or visualize neural network concepts."
