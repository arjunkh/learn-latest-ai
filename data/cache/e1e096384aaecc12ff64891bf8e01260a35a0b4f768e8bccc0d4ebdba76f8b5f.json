  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.21419v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a refined approach to three-way conflict analysis by separating alliance and conflict functions. This method addresses challenges in interpreting how agents relate to issues, as traditional models may misrepresent these relationships. For instance, a pairing of alliance +1 and conflict -1 could yield the same average as neutrality 0, despite differing attitudes. This distinction is significant for understanding complex interactions in various fields, including politics and social dynamics.",

    "eli12": "This study offers a clearer way to understand conflicts by breaking down how people or groups relate to each other. Think of it like sorting out friends and foes in a game, where knowing who supports or opposes you matters. This clarity could help everyday people navigate social situations or group decisions more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of understanding user relationships in conflict scenarios. By distinguishing between alliance and conflict, teams could develop tools that better address user needs and improve engagement. This could lead to more efficient conflict resolution features in products aimed at collaborative environments.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study proposes a model that separates alliance and conflict functions, enhancing the clarity of conflict analysis. This separation allows for more accurate aggregations of relationships among agents concerning various issues. Such a model could improve existing algorithms used in social network analysis or conflict resolution systems."
