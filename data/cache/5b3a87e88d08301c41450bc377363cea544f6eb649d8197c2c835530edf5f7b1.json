  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.09794v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Computational models have emerged as powerful tools for energy modeling research, touting scalability and quantitative results. However, these models require a plethora of data, some of which is inaccessible, expensive, or raises privacy concerns. We introduce a modular multimodal framework to produce this data from publicly accessible residential information and images using generative artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we provide a pipeline demonstrating this framework, and we evaluate its generative AI components. Our experiments show that our framework's use of AI avoids common issues with generative models. Our framework produces realistic, labeled data. By reducing dependence on costly or restricted data sources, we pave a path towards more accessible and reproducible research.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to build a model of a cityâ€™s energy usage but lacking the necessary data. This new framework acts like a tool that generates the needed information from publicly available resources. It could help researchers create better models without running into privacy issues or high costs. This matters to everyday people as it could lead to more efficient energy use and sustainable urban planning.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a growing user need for accessible and realistic data in energy modeling. It could lower costs associated with data acquisition, making it easier to develop energy-efficient solutions. A practical implication is that businesses can leverage this data to create better products tailored to urban energy needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the framework utilizes generative AI to produce labeled synthetic data, addressing common challenges seen in traditional generative models. It demonstrates a pipeline that effectively integrates publicly accessible information and images to generate realistic outputs. This approach could streamline data generation processes, though engineers should remain mindful of the limitations inherent in synthetic data."
