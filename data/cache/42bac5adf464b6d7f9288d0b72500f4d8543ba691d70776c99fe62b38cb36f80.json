  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.03359v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.",

  "speedrun": "A new study proposes a multi-agentic workflow to improve how Large Language Models (LLMs) follow instructions. By separating task descriptions from formal constraints, this method uses quantitative feedback to refine prompts. The results show that models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B achieve significantly higher compliance scores with this approach. This matters because enhancing LLM performance could lead to more reliable applications in various fields.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This method could help developers create more accurate AI systems, making them more useful in real-world applications.",
    "It signals a shift towards more structured and efficient prompt engineering, which could elevate the overall quality of AI outputs."

    "eli12": "Imagine teaching a child to follow a recipe. Instead of just telling them what to cook, you also explain the steps and rules they must follow. This study shows how separating tasks from constraints helps AI models like Llama 3.1 understand instructions better, leading to more accurate results. This is important for everyday users who rely on AI for clear and correct information.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this new workflow highlights a user need for more precise AI interaction. By optimizing prompts with clear constraints, teams could enhance user experience and reduce errors. This could lead to more efficient product development cycles and better user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this study introduces a workflow that separates the optimization of task descriptions from the constraints that govern them. Using quantitative scores as feedback, the method iteratively improves prompts, resulting in significantly higher compliance scores—up to 20% more for models like Llama 3.1 8B. This approach could refine how engineers design and implement AI systems."
