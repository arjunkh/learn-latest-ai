  "speedrun": "A new approach to building large language model (LLM) applications focuses on integrating multimodal inputs and structured outputs, specifically using a tool called o3. This method allows developers to create systems like time-series anomaly detection through visualization and prompting. By combining visual data with textual analysis, the process becomes more intuitive and effective. This innovation could enhance how businesses monitor and react to anomalies in real-time data streams.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can now create more effective anomaly detection systems, improving response times for specific industries like finance or healthcare.",
    "This approach signals a shift towards more integrated AI solutions, potentially changing how businesses utilize data across various sectors."

    "eli12": "Think of this as teaching a computer to not only read but also to see and understand pictures. By combining images with text, it can spot unusual patterns in data more easily. This matters because it could help companies catch problems faster, like identifying fraud or equipment failures before they escalate.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this method highlights the need for tools that can handle multiple types of data seamlessly. By integrating visual and textual inputs, the cost of developing data-driven solutions may decrease while efficiency improves. This could mean faster product iterations and a better user experience for clients needing real-time insights.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, using o3 allows for the integration of time-series data with visual prompts, enhancing the anomaly detection process. This multimodal approach could lead to more accurate models, as it leverages both visual cues and textual context. However, developers should ensure that the system's complexity does not hinder usability."
