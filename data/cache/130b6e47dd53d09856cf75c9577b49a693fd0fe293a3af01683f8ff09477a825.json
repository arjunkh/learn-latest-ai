    "eli12": "AWS is making it easier for users to adjust AI models to fit their needs, similar to how you might customize a recipe to suit your taste. With new tools like reinforcement fine-tuning and Kiro Powers, developers can tweak models for better performance. This matters because it means more effective AI solutions that can adapt to everyday challenges.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, AWS's new customization tools could significantly reduce development time and costs. By enabling more precise adjustments to AI models, these features help meet user needs more efficiently. This means teams can focus on innovation rather than spending time on basic model adjustments.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AWS's reinforcement fine-tuning allows for more granular control over model behavior, which can improve performance metrics. The expanded Strands SDK and the introduction of Kiro Powers offer engineers new capabilities for model adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these tools will depend on their integration into existing workflows."
