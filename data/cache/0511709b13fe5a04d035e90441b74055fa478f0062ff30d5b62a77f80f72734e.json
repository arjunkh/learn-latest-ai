    "eli12": "Imagine having a smart assistant that learns from your expertise and helps you make better choices. This approach combines human insight with AI's analytical power, which could lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. For everyday people, this means potentially better healthcare experiences and outcomes.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this approach highlights the need to create AI tools that work alongside clinicians rather than replace them. It emphasizes efficiency and user needs, suggesting that products should enhance decision-making processes. A practical implication is the opportunity to develop AI systems that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this method uses advanced AI models that leverage clinician input to enhance decision-making capabilities. By integrating human expertise, these systems may achieve higher diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional AI models. However, ensuring the reliability of these models in diverse clinical settings remains a key challenge."
