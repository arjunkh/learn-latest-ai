To demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical knowledge. By clarifying both \\textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG and \\textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoW0bNBPglQ.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called CoFE generates counterfactual ECGs to clarify how specific features affect AI-based ECG predictions. It showcases its effectiveness through case studies on atrial fibrillation and potassium levels. This is crucial now as it aims to improve the understanding of AI decisions in cardiac diagnostics, making them more reliable for doctors and patients.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Doctors and patients can trust AI predictions more, leading to better heart health management.",
    "The healthcare sector may see a shift towards AI tools that are not only accurate but also explainable, enhancing their adoption."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to understand a complex recipe. The CoFE framework acts like a guide, showing how each ingredient—like heart signal features—affects the final dish, or in this case, the AI's predictions. This clarity helps doctors make better decisions, which is important for anyone concerned about heart health.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the CoFE framework highlights the need for explainable AI in healthcare products. It addresses user concerns about trust and transparency, which can set a product apart in a competitive market. A practical next step is to integrate similar explainable features into existing AI tools.",
    "engineer": "The CoFE framework uses counterfactuals to explain AI predictions based on ECG signals, focusing on features like amplitudes and intervals. While it aligns with established clinical knowledge, the approach may still face challenges in broader application and real-world variability. Understanding these limitations is key for developers working on AI in healthcare."
