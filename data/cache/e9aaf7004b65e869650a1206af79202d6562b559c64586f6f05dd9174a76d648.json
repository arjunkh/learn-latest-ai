    "eli12": "Imagine a Swiss Army knife that can do many jobs instead of a tool designed for just one task. Anthropic’s AI plugins are like that knife, potentially replacing specific tools in the legal field. This matters because if AI can handle legal tasks, it might change how lawyers work and the types of jobs available in the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Anthropic's AI plugins signal a need to rethink user needs and product offerings. If general-purpose AI can efficiently perform legal tasks, it could reduce costs and reshape market competition. This suggests that businesses may need to innovate or pivot their strategies to stay relevant in a changing landscape.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Anthropic's AI plugins leverage a general-purpose model that competes with domain-specific solutions in the legal space. This raises questions about performance benchmarks, as general models could potentially match or exceed the efficiency of specialized tools. However, the long-term reliability and accuracy of these plugins remain to be fully evaluated."
