  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.17644v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence deployed in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and security must not only achieve predictive accuracy but also ensure transparency, ethical alignment, and compliance with regulatory expectations. Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols and future directions for scaling neuro symbolic frameworks in complex, high stakes environments.",

    "eli12": "Hybrid neuro-symbolic models are like a team of detectives: one gathers clues quickly (neural networks), while the other analyzes the evidence thoroughly (symbolic reasoning). Together, they can solve complex problems while ensuring everyone understands the process. This is important for everyday people as it means AI can be trusted in sensitive areas like health and finance.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, these hybrid models could meet user demands for reliable and explainable AI solutions. They might reduce costs associated with compliance and increase user trust. A practical implication is that developing AI systems with these models could lead to faster regulatory approval.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, hybrid neuro-symbolic models leverage the strengths of deep learning and symbolic reasoning, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability. Techniques like integrating knowledge graphs and embedding fairness-aware rules are crucial for ethical alignment. These models show promise in providing reliable AI solutions in critical domains, although scalability remains a challenge."
