    "eli12": "Quasi geo-lift experiments help marketers see how their ads perform by comparing areas that got ads to those that didn’t. It’s like testing a new recipe in one kitchen while keeping the old one running in another. This matters because it helps businesses spend their money wisely, ensuring they get the best results from their marketing efforts.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, quasi geo-lift experiments could enhance understanding of user engagement and campaign effectiveness. By measuring the impact of marketing in similar regions, teams can identify the most cost-effective strategies. This method could lead to better resource allocation and improved user acquisition strategies.",
    "engineer": "Quasi geo-lift experiments utilize statistical techniques to compare performance metrics across similar geographic areas, isolating the effects of marketing interventions. This method enhances data reliability by controlling for external variables. However, careful selection of comparable regions is crucial to avoid skewed results."
