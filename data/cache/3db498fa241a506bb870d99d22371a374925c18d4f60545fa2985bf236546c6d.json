  "speedrun": "Tmux, or Terminal Multiplexer, is a tool that enhances your terminal experience by allowing you to split a single window into multiple panes. This multitasking capability can significantly improve productivity by enabling simultaneous work on different tasks. For example, you could run a server in one pane while editing code in another. As more developers adopt command-line tools, Tmux's utility becomes increasingly relevant.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can manage multiple tasks efficiently, reducing the need to switch between windows and improving focus.",
    "The rise of command-line tools indicates a broader trend towards streamlined workflows in software development and system administration."

    "eli12": "Tmux is like having multiple tabs open in a web browser, but for your terminal. It allows you to work on several tasks at once without losing track of any. This is helpful for programmers who want to run scripts and edit files simultaneously. As more people use command-line tools, knowing Tmux could make daily tasks easier.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Tmux addresses the user need for efficient task management in coding environments. By enabling multitasking within a single terminal, it could reduce time spent switching between applications. This efficiency gain could lead to faster development cycles and more streamlined project management.",
    "engineer": "Tmux provides a flexible environment for developers by allowing terminal sessions to be split into multiple panes. This feature supports simultaneous execution of commands and monitoring of outputs, which can enhance workflow efficiency. As a terminal multiplexer, Tmux can also maintain sessions across disconnects, making it useful for remote work."
