    "eli12": "Think of internal benchmarks like a personalized fitness test. Just as you would track your progress in a gym, companies can measure how well different AI models perform for their unique needs. This helps them find the best fit for their projects, making life easier for everyone involved.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this means having the tools to evaluate AI models based on specific user needs. By creating tailored benchmarks, they can ensure their product uses the most effective AI, giving them an edge in the market. A practical next step would be to start developing these benchmarks for upcoming projects.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, building internal benchmarks allows for a more granular assessment of LLMs. This method can highlight strengths and weaknesses based on real-world applications. However, ensuring these benchmarks are comprehensive and unbiased is crucial to avoid misleading results."
