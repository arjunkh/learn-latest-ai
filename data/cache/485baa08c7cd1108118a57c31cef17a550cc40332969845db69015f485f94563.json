  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.21866v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling) reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse (complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse architectural approaches.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights a significant limitation in decoder-only autoregressive language models like OPT and Pythia. Despite scaling up parameters by 240 times, accuracy in knowledge retrieval tasks barely improved, remaining at 19-20%. This suggests that simply increasing model size may not enhance performance in knowledge-intensive applications, raising questions about the effectiveness of current architectures.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Engineers and developers focusing on knowledge retrieval may need to reconsider their approach, as increasing model size yields minimal improvements. This could lead to shifts in resource allocation strategies.",
    "The findings indicate a broader trend in AI, where scaling models may not always correlate with better performance, prompting a reevaluation of design strategies across the industry."

    "eli12": "This study shows that just making AI models bigger doesnâ€™t always mean they get better at certain tasks. For example, even with a huge increase in size, a model struggled to improve its accuracy on knowledge retrieval tasks. This is important for everyday users because it suggests that smarter design might be needed to solve complex problems.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research indicates that investing in larger models may not yield the expected returns in knowledge-intensive applications. Understanding the limitations of scaling can help in prioritizing features that truly enhance user experience. A focus on innovative design rather than size could lead to more effective solutions.",
    "engineer": "The study reveals that models like OPT and Pythia exhibit capability ceilings, particularly in knowledge retrieval tasks, where accuracy stagnates despite a 31% drop in cross-entropy loss. This indicates that traditional scaling methods may not suffice for improving performance. Additionally, attention intervention experiments show that altering attention patterns can lead to severe performance drops, emphasizing the need for careful architectural considerations."
