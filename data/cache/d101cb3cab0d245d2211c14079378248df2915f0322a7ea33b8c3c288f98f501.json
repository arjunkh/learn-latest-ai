    "eli12": "Imagine trying to use a smartphone without knowing how to operate it. That's similar to what many workers face with industrial AI. The study shows that while companies want to adopt AI, many employees feel unprepared and unsure. This matters because it affects how quickly industries can improve and innovate, which ultimately impacts jobs and the economy.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study underscores the importance of user education and support. Understanding that many potential users are hesitant due to skill gaps can inform product design and training programs. By addressing these needs, companies could enhance user adoption and maximize the efficiency of their AI solutions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the study indicates that despite rapid AI advancements, the workforce's lack of familiarity with the technology remains a barrier. Many employees may not be equipped to implement AI tools effectively, which could lead to underutilization of these systems. Engineers should consider developing more intuitive interfaces and comprehensive training resources to bridge these gaps."
