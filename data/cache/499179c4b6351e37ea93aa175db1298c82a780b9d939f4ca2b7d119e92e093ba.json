  "speedrun": "The article emphasizes a gradual and thoughtful integration of AI into existing products rather than forcing AI into a chatbot format. It argues that this organic approach can enhance user experience and functionality. By focusing on specific use cases, companies can better meet user needs and avoid overwhelming them with technology. This matters now as businesses seek effective ways to leverage AI without alienating their customer base.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies that adopt this approach could enhance customer satisfaction by providing tailored solutions that feel more intuitive.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend where businesses prioritize user experience over simply adding AI features for the sake of it."

    "eli12": "Instead of cramming AI into a chatbot, companies can slowly weave it into their products, like adding spices to a dish for better flavor. This makes technology feel more natural and helpful. It matters for everyday people because they benefit from smoother, more intuitive interactions with the tools they use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this approach highlights the need to identify specific user problems that AI can solve, rather than adopting AI for its own sake. It could lead to more efficient solutions that fit seamlessly into existing workflows. Practically, this means conducting user research to find the right applications for AI.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, integrating AI incrementally allows for better testing and refinement of algorithms within existing frameworks. This could involve using models that enhance specific functionalities without overhauling entire systems. A careful approach can lead to more reliable performance and user acceptance."
