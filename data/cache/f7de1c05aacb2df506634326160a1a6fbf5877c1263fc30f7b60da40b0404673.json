    "eli12": "When AWS went down, many AI applications stopped working, showing that even smart tech can face problems. It’s like relying on one power source for your home; if it goes out, everything shuts down. This matters to everyone because it highlights the importance of having backup plans, especially as we rely more on technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this outage emphasizes the need to assess risks associated with cloud dependency. Users expect seamless AI experiences, and outages can lead to lost trust. Considering multi-cloud strategies could enhance reliability and ensure that services remain available even during disruptions.",
    "engineer": "The AWS outage revealed that AI applications are as dependent on cloud infrastructure as any other service. This incident raises questions about system architecture and redundancy measures. Engineers might need to implement failover systems and explore distributed models to ensure higher availability and resilience in future deployments."
