They’ll provide mental-health care for millions, unimpeded by the pesky requirements for human counselors, like the need for graduate degrees, malpractice insurance, and sleep.

This raises ethical concerns about transparency and the quality of care. The article emphasizes that while AI could enhance mental health support, it also risks undermining trust between clients and therapists. This issue is increasingly relevant as AI technology becomes more integrated into personal care.",

    "eli12": "Imagine going to a doctor who secretly uses a machine to diagnose you without telling you. That’s similar to what’s happening with some therapists using AI like ChatGPT. It raises questions about trust and care in therapy. For everyday people, this matters because it affects how they connect with their mental health providers.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this situation highlights a user need for transparency in AI applications in mental health. The cost of integrating AI could be offset by improved access to care, but ethical implications must be addressed. Practically, this means ensuring that users are informed about AI involvement in their therapy sessions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the use of ChatGPT in therapy suggests a growing reliance on natural language processing models for sensitive applications. However, the lack of transparency poses risks, as the model's responses may not always align with ethical standards in mental health care. This raises important questions about the safeguards needed when deploying AI in such critical areas."
