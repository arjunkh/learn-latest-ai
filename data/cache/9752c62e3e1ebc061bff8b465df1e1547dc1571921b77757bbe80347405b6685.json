  "speedrun": "AI is shifting towards edge computing, where data processing occurs closer to the source rather than in centralized data centers. This change promises faster response times and better compliance with regulations. With tighter regulations, especially in sectors like healthcare and finance, edge computing could help organizations maintain control over sensitive data. This shift matters now as businesses seek to enhance efficiency while adhering to stricter rules.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies in regulated industries will benefit from faster data processing and improved compliance, enhancing their operational efficiency.",
    "This trend indicates a broader market shift towards decentralized computing, which could reshape how businesses handle data privacy and security."

    "eli12": "Imagine if your favorite streaming service could load movies directly from your device instead of a faraway server. That's what edge computing does—making things quicker and more efficient. For everyday people, this means faster apps and services that respect privacy, especially in areas like healthcare.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this shift to edge computing highlights a growing user need for speed and compliance. It could reduce costs associated with data transfer and storage. A practical implication is that products will need to be designed for local processing capabilities, enhancing user experience and trust.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, edge computing allows for real-time data processing, reducing latency significantly compared to traditional cloud models. This approach can leverage smaller, localized servers or devices, which improves compliance with data regulations. However, developers must ensure that these systems can handle the computational load efficiently."
