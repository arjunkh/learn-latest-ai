  "speedrun": "A recent analysis by MIT Technology Review reveals the significant energy consumption of the AI industry, detailing how much power is used for individual queries. For instance, it takes about 1,000 times more energy to train a large AI model than to run a single query. This insight matters now as the AI sector continues to grow, prompting discussions on sustainable energy practices and potential regulations.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "AI developers and companies could face increased scrutiny regarding their energy consumption, impacting operational costs and practices.",
    "The findings suggest a broader shift towards more sustainable AI practices, which could influence investment and innovation in energy-efficient technologies."

    "eli12": "Imagine if every time you asked a question, it required the same energy as turning on a light bulb for a whole day. That’s what AI’s energy use looks like. Understanding this helps us see how our growing reliance on AI could affect the planet, making it essential for everyone to consider sustainable solutions.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this energy insight highlights a critical user need for more efficient AI solutions. As energy costs rise, focusing on reducing power consumption could lead to better margins and a competitive edge in the market. This also opens up opportunities for developing energy-efficient AI products.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the MIT analysis emphasizes the energy intensity of training large AI models, which can consume up to 1,000 times the energy of a single query. This data suggests a need for engineers to innovate in optimizing model architectures and training processes, potentially leveraging techniques like model distillation or more efficient hardware."
