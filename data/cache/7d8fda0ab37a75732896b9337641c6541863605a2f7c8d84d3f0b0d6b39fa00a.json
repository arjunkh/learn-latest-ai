    "eli12": "Using AI in code reviews is like having a smart assistant that spots mistakes before they become problems. It helps engineers find risks in their code that they might overlook. This matters because it can lead to fewer software bugs and a more stable experience for users.",
    "pm": "For product managers, AI-driven code reviews could streamline development by catching issues early, saving time and resources. This efficiency might allow teams to focus on innovation rather than fixing bugs, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and product quality.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Datadog's AI integration in code reviews helps identify systemic risks at scale, which traditional methods may overlook. This approach could improve deployment stability, especially in distributed systems, where quick iterations are often necessary. However, the article doesn't discuss specific models or benchmarks used in their AI implementation."
