  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.13700v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed a new framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs). This system, which operates on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, combines retrieval augmented generation and structured response methods. In tests, it achieved high accuracy compared to expert annotations and even identified errors missed during manual reviews. This advancement could significantly reduce the time and resources required for clinical research.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This technology could streamline the workflow for clinical researchers, allowing them to focus on analysis rather than data extraction.",
    "The shift towards automated data extraction reflects a broader trend in healthcare, aiming to enhance efficiency and accuracy in managing patient information."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to find specific ingredients in a messy kitchen. This new framework acts like a smart assistant that quickly organizes and retrieves what you need from the chaos of patient records. It matters because it could save time and reduce errors in healthcare, making it easier for doctors and researchers to access vital information.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a growing need for efficient data management tools in healthcare. By automating data extraction, it could lower costs and improve the speed of clinical research. This means products could be developed faster and with more reliable data, enhancing overall healthcare outcomes.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this framework leverages locally deployed LLMs and integrates retrieval augmented generation with structured response methods. It demonstrated high accuracy in feature extraction when evaluated against expert-annotated datasets. This suggests that LLMs can effectively handle complex medical data, although the article does not detail specific models or benchmarks used."
