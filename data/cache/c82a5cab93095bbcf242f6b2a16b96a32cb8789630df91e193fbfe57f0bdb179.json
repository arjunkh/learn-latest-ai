  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.00075v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher quality AI policy.",

  "speedrun": "A recent position paper argues that NeurIPS, a leading AI conference, should spearhead the formation of scientific consensus on AI policy. The authors highlight a significant gap in mechanisms for achieving consensus, despite existing methods for generating and synthesizing evidence. They suggest that NeurIPS can draw lessons from the IPCC, which successfully established consensus on climate policy. This initiative could enhance the quality of AI policy, making it more effective for society.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to bake a cake without a recipe. That's how AI policy feels right nowâ€”there's evidence, but no shared understanding. NeurIPS could help create that recipe by fostering agreement among experts. This matters because better policies could lead to safer and more effective AI that benefits everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this push for consensus means clearer guidelines for developing AI products. If NeurIPS succeeds, it could streamline compliance processes and reduce risks associated with AI regulations. This could save time and resources, allowing teams to focus on innovation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the paper emphasizes the need for structured consensus mechanisms akin to those used by the IPCC. While current evidence generation methods exist, they lack a cohesive approach to synthesizing this information into a unified policy framework. Engineers could benefit from clearer guidelines that emerge from this consensus, leading to more robust AI systems."
