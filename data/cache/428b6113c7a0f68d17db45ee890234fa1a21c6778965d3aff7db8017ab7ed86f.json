It’s a genuine growth story. We look forward to connecting with fellow creators in the world of code and thought.\"\nAn Odyssey of Tech, Teamwork, and Tenacity\n1. Echoes of a Golden Age\nThe year was 2012, and the mobile internet boom was in full swing. Our trio, a formidable alliance of two backend developers and a UI/UX designer with a keen product sense, stood at the epicenter of this revolution. We built several utility apps that garnered millions of monthly active users. This was the \"king of tools, traffic is cash\" era—a golden age of mobile internet that we experienced from its nascent beginnings to its peak.\n2. The AI Awakening\nFast forward to late 2023. As large language models began to show their disruptive potential, we felt a familiar stir—history was repeating itself. Our initial experiments with a few MVP products didn't quite take off due to model limitations, but the pace of technological advancement was breathtaking. The cognitive leap of ChatGPT-like models, the rapid maturity of multimodal capabilities, and the explosion of the open-source ecosystem made one thing clear: The Warring States period of AI-native applications was upon us.\n3. Back to Our Roots: Rebuilding with AI\nWe excel at building tools that solve real problems. So, we decided to return to our roots and leverage AI to reinvent traditional applications in a vertical niche. As the saying goes, \"every product is ripe for an AI reboot.\" We're focused on a global audience, launching our app in 10 languages—Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, French, and German—with a primary focus on Western markets.\n4. Setting Sail: A Global Expedition\nAs our app makes its debut on international app stores, we know this is more than just a product launch. It's a new chapter for a group of veterans from the mobile internet's golden age, a new footnote in the AGI revolution. We aren't seeking to leave an indelible mark on AI history. We just want to be a part of it, to have the experience and the memories. This journey, fueled by our shared passion for technology and product design, is a mission we're pouring our all into.\nTo satisfy your curiosity, here's the lowdown on our app:\nDietCam – Your AI-Powered Calorie & Food Tracker. Manage your weight and hit your goals with precision.\nDietCam makes calorie tracking effortless and accurate. Snap a photo of your meal, and our advanced AI instantly provides a detailed breakdown of calories and macros. Whether you're aiming to lose weight, build muscle, or maintain a healthy lifestyle, DietCam helps you reach your goals with ease.\nWe're up against formidable competitors like Cal AI, developed by a well-known 18-year-old, and other established health management software. We've optimized many of the calculation and tracking processes, and we’ve fine-tuned our deep analysis in AI recognition to ensure our app's calculations are as precise as possible.\n Our official website is now live:https://dietcam--fir-ai-app-dev.us-central1.hosted.app/\nWe'll be documenting our entire journey and sharing it with all of you, including our tech stack decisions, the challenges we've faced, and more. We hope to connect with other like-minded individuals as we move forward.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45000868\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
