    "eli12": "The Greedy Boruta Algorithm speeds up the process of selecting important features in data while keeping accuracy high. Think of it like a chef who can prepare a meal faster without compromising taste. This matters because quicker data analysis can lead to better and faster decisions in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this algorithm means they can build faster and more efficient data-driven products. By reducing computation time, teams can allocate resources more effectively, leading to cost savings. A practical implication is that quicker insights could enhance user experience and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The Greedy Boruta Algorithm modifies the original Boruta method to optimize feature selection by reducing computation time significantly while maintaining high recall rates. This approach allows for quicker iterations in model training, which is crucial in environments with large datasets. However, it’s important to monitor the trade-offs between speed and the potential for missing less obvious but important features."
