  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.14382v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and generalizable web agents.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights the limitations of evaluating web agents powered by large language models (LLMs), which often focus on overall success rather than intermediate errors. This study proposes a new modular evaluation framework that breaks down agent pipelines into interpretable stages, allowing for fine-grained error analysis. By using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset, the researchers reveal weaknesses that traditional metrics overlook. This could lead to more reliable and adaptable web agents, which is crucial as these technologies become more integrated into daily tasks.",

    "eli12": "This research shows that while web agents can handle complex tasks, we often miss the little mistakes they make along the way. Think of it like a car that drives well overall but has a flat tire. By breaking down the process into smaller parts, we can find and fix these issues, making the technology more dependable for everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this new framework highlights the importance of understanding user interactions at each step. Instead of just measuring success, focusing on where users encounter problems could lead to more efficient designs. This approach can help create web agents that better meet user needs and reduce costs associated with troubleshooting.",
    "engineer": "This study emphasizes the need for a modular evaluation framework for web agents, allowing for detailed analysis of their performance. By utilizing the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset, the researchers demonstrate how standard metrics can overlook critical errors. This fine-grained analysis could lead to significant improvements in the robustness and generalizability of LLM-powered agents."
