  "speedrun": "Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, while competitors in the commercial space industry, both advocate for human settlement in space, viewing it as essential for survival. However, recent discussions highlight growing skepticism about the practicality of this vision. Critics argue that the immense resources required for such endeavors could be better spent addressing pressing issues on Earth. This debate is crucial now as humanity grapples with climate change and resource scarcity.",

    "eli12": "Musk and Bezos think humans should live in space to survive, but some people worry this is too costly. Imagine trying to build a house in the sky while your home on the ground needs repairs. This debate matters because it affects how we prioritize our resources and future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this discussion around human settlement in space emphasizes the need to balance innovation with practicality. As resources are scrutinized, they might need to consider how their products can solve urgent Earth-based issues while still pushing boundaries in tech.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the debate highlights the challenges of current space technologies and resource allocation. With companies investing billions, like SpaceX's Starship and Blue Origin's New Glenn, engineers must assess the feasibility against Earth's immediate needs. This underscores the importance of sustainable innovation in aerospace engineering."
