    "eli12": "Slash commands are like shortcuts on your keyboard that help you do things faster while coding. By using them, engineers can quickly complete tasks without getting bogged down in details. This matters because it helps developers stay focused and productive, making their jobs easier and more enjoyable.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, implementing slash commands can significantly enhance user experience by reducing friction in coding tasks. This could lead to higher productivity and lower costs as engineers spend less time on mundane tasks. Prioritizing tools that support these commands could be a smart move for teams aiming to improve efficiency.",
    "engineer": "The article emphasizes that using slash commands can cut coding time by around 30%, allowing engineers to automate tasks and navigate their environments more effectively. This method can be particularly useful in collaborative settings where multiple developers are working on the same project. However, the article doesn't delve into potential learning curves associated with adopting these commands."
