  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.02170v2 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present Flowchart2Mermaid, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.",

  "speedrun": "Flowchart2Mermaid is a new web system that transforms static flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code, making workflow diagrams more interactive. It utilizes advanced vision-language models to interpret flowcharts and allows users to refine diagrams with inline editing and natural-language commands. This tool stands out by providing a structured, version-controllable text representation that syncs with the visual output. Its significance lies in enhancing collaboration and efficiency in creating and modifying process diagrams.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This tool could greatly benefit professionals who rely on flowcharts, as it allows for easier updates and collaboration on processes.",
    "On a broader scale, it reflects a shift towards more dynamic, editable digital tools in workflow management, which could streamline project development."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Flowchart2Mermaid is like turning a static photo of a recipe into an editable document where you can add notes and make changes. This makes it easier for everyone to collaborate on projects, as they can quickly adjust diagrams instead of starting from scratch. It matters because it could save time and improve communication in teams.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, Flowchart2Mermaid addresses the user need for flexibility in workflow diagrams. By converting static images into editable code, it could reduce the time and cost associated with diagram updates. This means teams can iterate faster and maintain clear communication on processes.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Flowchart2Mermaid employs vision-language models to convert flowchart images into Mermaid.js code, enabling structured representation and version control. The system includes evaluation metrics for assessing structural accuracy and syntax validity, ensuring high-quality output. This approach improves upon previous image-to-diagram tools by maintaining synchronization between the text and visual elements."
