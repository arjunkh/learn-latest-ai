    "eli12": "The pharmaceutical industry is facing tough times due to rising costs and supply chain issues. Think of it like a restaurant struggling with ingredient prices while trying to keep meal prices low. This matters because it could affect how much we pay for medicines and their availability in the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in pharma, this scenario highlights the need for efficient cost management and innovative solutions. As companies face pressure to keep drug prices down, understanding user needs around affordability could guide product development. This environment might also open opportunities for new approaches to drug manufacturing and distribution.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the pharmaceutical industry is likely to explore more efficient manufacturing processes and supply chain optimizations. The rising costs of raw materials could drive the adoption of AI-driven analytics to predict trends and manage inventory better. However, companies must balance innovation with regulatory compliance and safety standards."
