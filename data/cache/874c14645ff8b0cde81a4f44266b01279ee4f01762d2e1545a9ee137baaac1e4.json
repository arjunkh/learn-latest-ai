    "eli12": "Sneha Goenka has created a new way to quickly read a person's entire genetic code, which can help doctors find out if someone has a genetic disorder. Imagine being able to read a long book in just a few minutes instead of days. This matters because quicker diagnoses can lead to better treatments and healthier lives for many people.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Goenka's work highlights a growing user need for rapid and accurate genetic testing solutions. The efficiency gained could reduce costs associated with prolonged diagnostic processes. A practical takeaway is to consider how technology can streamline healthcare services and improve patient experiences.",
    "engineer": "Goenka's method utilizes advanced computational techniques to achieve unprecedented speed in whole-genome sequencing. This could involve optimizing algorithms that process genomic data, reducing the time to diagnosis significantly. Such innovations may set new benchmarks for genomic analysis, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in medical diagnostics."
