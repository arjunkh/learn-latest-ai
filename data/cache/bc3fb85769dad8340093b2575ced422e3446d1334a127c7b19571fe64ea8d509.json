  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.07997v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the data they collect and include only the most important or informative measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning performs on average 10.0\\% better than the best heuristic method, while reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\\% better. We also show that both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts of data.",

    "eli12": "Earth observation satellites gather crucial data about our planet, but they have limitations, like fixed paths and limited sensor views. The new learning-based methods help these satellites adjust their focus dynamically, much like a camera that can zoom in on important events. This means we could get better insights into environmental changes, which matters because it helps everyone understand and respond to our planet's needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a growing user need for more efficient data collection from satellites. By adopting learning-based methods, they could enhance the value of satellite missions while reducing resource costs. A practical implication is that companies could leverage these techniques to offer improved insights for environmental monitoring services.",
