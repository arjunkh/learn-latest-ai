    "eli12": "Commonwealth Fusion Systems is making waves by signing a big electricity deal for a fusion power plant that isn’t built yet. Think of it like a restaurant taking reservations before opening its doors. This matters because it shows that companies believe fusion could be a real energy source in the future, which could lead to cleaner energy for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the billion-dollar deal with Eni underscores the importance of addressing user needs for sustainable energy solutions. It suggests a market readiness for innovative energy products, even those still in development. Companies might consider how to leverage this momentum to create complementary services or technologies that support the fusion energy landscape.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the deal illustrates growing confidence in fusion technology despite the absence of operational reactors. Commonwealth Fusion Systems is developing a smaller reactor model, which could pave the way for larger commercial applications. Engineers should note that this investment reflects an increasing interest in advanced energy solutions, potentially driving further research and development in fusion technologies."
