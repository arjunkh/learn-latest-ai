    "eli12": "OpenAI asked over 1,000 people how they think AI should act. By comparing these views to their AI guidelines, they aim to make AI more in tune with what people want. Think of it like asking a group of friends how to plan a party to ensure everyone enjoys it. This matters because it helps create AI that feels more relatable and trustworthy for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this survey highlights the need to incorporate user feedback into AI design. Understanding diverse perspectives can reduce friction and enhance user satisfaction. As AI becomes more prevalent, aligning product features with user values could improve adoption and trust, ultimately leading to better business outcomes.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, OpenAI's approach emphasizes the importance of aligning AI behavior with user expectations. By analyzing feedback from over 1,000 respondents, they can refine their Model Spec to better reflect diverse values. This method could lead to more robust and adaptable AI systems, but engineers should consider the complexity of integrating varied human perspectives into model training."
