    "eli12": "The article shows how to use Excel for Logistic Regression, which is like baking a cake using a simple recipe. You gather ingredients (data), mix them (apply the formula), and bake (analyze the results). This matters because it helps everyday people make sense of data without needing to learn complicated coding.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this approach highlights a user need for accessible data analysis tools. By simplifying Logistic Regression in Excel, they can make data-driven decisions without heavy investment in technical resources. This could lead to more efficient product development processes.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the article walks through the implementation of Logistic Regression, focusing on key concepts like the logistic function and maximum likelihood estimation. It emphasizes using Excel’s built-in functions to calculate probabilities and interpret results, making it a practical reference for engineers looking to apply statistics without extensive coding."
