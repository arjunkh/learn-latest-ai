  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.05256v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.",

  "speedrun": "Naiad is a new AI system designed for comprehensive monitoring of inland waters, using advanced language models and data analysis tools. Unlike traditional methods that tackle water quality issues in isolation, Naiad integrates various data sources into a single interface. It has achieved over 77% accuracy and 85% relevance in tests, making it a promising tool for both experts and non-experts. This innovation is crucial for timely interventions to protect public health and ecosystems.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Naiad could significantly enhance water quality monitoring for local authorities and environmentalists, enabling quicker responses to potential issues.",
    "This development reflects a shift towards more integrated, AI-driven solutions in environmental monitoring, highlighting the growing importance of technology in public health."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Naiad is like a smart assistant for monitoring water quality. Instead of looking at one problem at a time, it combines different data sources to give a complete picture. This matters for everyday people because cleaner water impacts health and recreation, making communities safer and more enjoyable.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Naiad addresses a clear user need for efficient water quality monitoring. By integrating various data sources, it could reduce costs and improve response times for environmental issues. This means there’s potential for developing user-friendly tools that simplify complex data analysis for non-experts.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Naiad utilizes Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to process and synthesize data from multiple sources, achieving over 77% correctness and 85% relevance. Its performance benefits from models like Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B), offering a balance of efficiency and reasoning. The system's adaptability across diverse query types is a key strength."
