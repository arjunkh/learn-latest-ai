  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.15067v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gliomas, among the most common primary brain tumors, vary widely in aggressiveness, prognosis, and histology, making treatment challenging due to complex and time-intensive surgical interventions. This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset.",

    "eli12": "This research showcases a new AI model that helps doctors better identify brain tumors. Think of it like using a high-powered camera to get a clearer picture of a complex scene. For everyday people, this means doctors could make more informed decisions about treatment options, potentially improving survival rates.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this model highlights the need for tools that improve diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. By enhancing segmentation and prognosis, it could reduce costs associated with misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments. A practical implication is that integrating such AI models into existing systems could streamline workflows and improve patient care.",
    "engineer": "The proposed R2U-Net model combines residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures to enhance brain tumor segmentation. It achieved a Dice Similarity Score of 0.900 on the BraTS2021 validation set, indicating strong performance. The model's ability to extract 64 features for survival prediction, which are then reduced to 28 via an ANN, demonstrates efficiency in feature representation while maintaining computational effectiveness."
