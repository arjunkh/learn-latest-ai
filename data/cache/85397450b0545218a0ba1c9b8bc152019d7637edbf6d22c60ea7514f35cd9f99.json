  "speedrun": "BMC is positioning itself as a key player in the field of agentic AI, which McKinsey suggests could unlock real value from generative AI. Despite nearly 80% of companies using generative AI, many struggle to see financial benefits. BMC aims to act as the 'orchestrator of orchestrators,' potentially streamlining the integration and effectiveness of AI tools. This approach is crucial now as businesses seek tangible returns on their AI investments.",
