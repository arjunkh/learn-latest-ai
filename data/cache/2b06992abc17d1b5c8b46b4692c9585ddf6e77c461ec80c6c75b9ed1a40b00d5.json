Thus, we advocate a shift from static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and operationalize it.",

  "speedrun": "A new study argues for a shift in mental health assessments from static methods to continuous, AI-driven evaluations, particularly for ADHD. The authors propose using mental health digital twins (MHDTs) to create personalized care pathways that adapt to individual patient needs. This approach could improve accessibility and effectiveness in treatment by utilizing ongoing data sampling. As mental health care evolves, embracing these digital tools could significantly enhance patient outcomes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For individuals with ADHD, this shift could lead to more tailored and timely interventions, enhancing their overall treatment experience.",
    "On a broader scale, integrating AI into mental health care signifies a move towards more dynamic and responsive healthcare systems, potentially reshaping how mental health is approached."

    "eli12": "The idea here is to move away from one-time mental health tests to ongoing assessments using AI. Think of it like having a fitness tracker that keeps updating your health stats instead of just a yearly check-up. This matters because it could help people get the right support when they need it most, making mental health care more relevant and effective for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights a growing need for tools that provide continuous mental health assessments. By focusing on user-centered design, products could be developed that offer real-time insights into mental health, improving efficiency and user engagement. This could lead to innovative solutions that better meet the evolving needs of users, particularly in ADHD care.",
    "engineer": "The study emphasizes the use of generative AI to create mental health digital twins (MHDTs), which are dynamic models that track individual symptom changes over time. By leveraging continuous data sampling, these models can facilitate ongoing assessments and personalized treatment plans. However, the implementation of such systems requires careful consideration of data privacy and accuracy to ensure they effectively support patient care."
