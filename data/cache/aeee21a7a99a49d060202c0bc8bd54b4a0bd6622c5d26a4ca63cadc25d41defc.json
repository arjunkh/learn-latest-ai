  "speedrun": "AI is a hot topic, with 58% of S&P 500 companies referencing it in recent earnings calls, according to Goldman Sachs. However, only 5% of generative AI pilots have moved beyond initial testing. This gap highlights the challenges businesses face in integrating AI into their operations effectively, raising questions about the future of AI adoption in the corporate world.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies eager to adopt AI may struggle to implement it effectively, risking wasted resources and missed opportunities.",
    "The low conversion rate from pilot to implementation could signal a broader hesitance in the market, impacting future AI investments and strategies."

    "eli12": "AI is everywhere in business discussions, but many companies aren’t using it effectively yet. With only 5% of AI projects making it past the testing phase, it’s like having a fancy car that stays in the garage. This matters because companies need to find ways to actually use AI to improve their operations and stay competitive.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the current situation highlights a significant need for practical AI solutions that can be implemented efficiently. The low success rate of generative AI pilots suggests that focusing on user-friendly tools could save time and resources. This could lead to better product development and a stronger market position.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the fact that only 5% of generative AI pilots succeed indicates a gap in operational execution and integration. Companies may be struggling with scaling models or aligning them with business goals. This emphasizes the need for robust frameworks and best practices to ensure that AI projects transition smoothly from pilot to production."
