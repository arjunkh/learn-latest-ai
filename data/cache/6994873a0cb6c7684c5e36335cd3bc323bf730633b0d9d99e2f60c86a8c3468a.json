    "eli12": "Imagine using a recipe to bake a cake, but instead, you're writing code to create a piece of art. This article shows how Python can help anyone generate colorful designs like those by famous artist Damien Hirst. It matters because it opens up art creation to more people, making it accessible and fun.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a growing user need for creative tools that leverage technology. By integrating art generation features into products, companies could enhance user engagement and differentiate themselves in the market. It also presents a cost-efficient way to create unique visual content.",
    "engineer": "The article discusses using Python algorithms to replicate the visual style of Hirst's work, focusing on generating colorful dot patterns. This approach can involve libraries like Matplotlib for rendering graphics. While the results can be impressive, the challenge lies in balancing creativity with the limitations of algorithmic design."
