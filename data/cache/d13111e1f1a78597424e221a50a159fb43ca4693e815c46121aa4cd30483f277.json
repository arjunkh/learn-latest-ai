  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.06227v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced a new framework for specifying non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), using an advanced form of temporal logic called Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories (LTLfMT). This approach allows for more complex task definitions in diverse data environments without the need for manual predicate encoding. The method has shown promise in continuous-control settings, making it easier to tackle complex goals. This development is significant as it could enhance how AI systems learn from intricate tasks in real-world applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could immediately benefit AI developers by streamlining the process of defining complex tasks, making it easier to implement in various applications.",
    "On a broader scale, this could signal a shift towards more sophisticated AI systems capable of handling unstructured data, potentially transforming industries reliant on AI."

    "eli12": "This new framework helps AI understand complex tasks better by using advanced logic that goes beyond simple yes or no questions. Imagine teaching a robot to navigate a maze not just by walls but by understanding different paths and their meanings. This matters because it could make everyday AI applications, like personal assistants or smart home devices, much more effective at understanding our needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, this framework could greatly influence how user needs are addressed in AI applications. It allows for defining complex user behaviors without extensive manual input, which could save time and reduce costs. Practically, this means teams can focus on higher-level design and user experience rather than getting bogged down in technical specifications.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this work leverages LTLfMT to specify rewards in MDPs, enhancing expressiveness for infinite-state spaces. The research identifies a tractable fragment of LTLfMT that balances complexity and usability, which is crucial for implementing reward machines. The application of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) alongside this logic shows promising results in continuous-control tasks, indicating a significant advancement in reward specification methodologies."
