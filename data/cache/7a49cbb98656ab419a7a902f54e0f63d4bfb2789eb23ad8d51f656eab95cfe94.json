  "raw_body": "Premiering November 19\nVentureBeat is proud to announce the launch of its new flagship podcast, Beyond the Pilot: Enterprise AI in Action, premiering November 19 and brought to you by our anchor sponsor, Outshift by Cisco.\nEnterprise AI has reached a new inflection point: workloads are going live, and the constraints are getting real. The challenge for enterprise technical leaders isn’t understanding AI’s potential — it’s navigating the messy, complex work of making it run reliably at scale. \nBeyond the Pilot goes inside that reality with candid conversations from executives who’ve moved past experiments and into production — scaling AI and agentic systems that deliver measurable business value.\n“Enterprise technical leaders keep telling us the same thing: the hype cycle is loud, but what they really need are credible stories about what works in production,” said Matt Marshall, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of VentureBeat. “With Beyond the Pilot, we’re doubling down on VentureBeat’s mission to serve the practitioners — the people actually responsible for delivering AI outcomes. We’re excited to bring a new level of depth, honesty, and technical insight to this conversation.”\nThrough in-depth, technically rigorous conversations, Beyond the Pilot unpacks the decisions, infrastructure, and organizational changes behind real-world AI deployments. The result: a practical look at what it takes to turn ambition into action.\nSeason 1: Real stories from the frontlines of enterprise AI\nThe debut episode features Notion, where VP AI Ryan Nystrom discusses how the company built Notion 3.0 for agents — and what it means to create an AI-native product inside a platform used by millions.\nUpcoming episodes will feature leaders from LinkedIn, Booking.com, JPMorgan, Mastercard, and LexisNexis, each sharing the inside story of scaling production AI systems inside complex global enterprises.\nA podcast for enterprise AI executors\nBeyond the Pilot is designed for senior managers, directors, VPs, and lead engineers responsible for turning AI strategy into tangible results. These are the decision-makers navigating the hardest problems in enterprise AI — model governance, infrastructure choices, security constraints, scaling challenges, and real ROI.\n\"At Outshift, we take emerging technologies from experimentation to production readiness,\" said Vijoy Pandey, SVP/GM of emerging tech incubator Outshift by Cisco. \"That's why we're supporting VentureBeat on Beyond the Pilot. The podcast features tech leaders sharing how they built and deployed AI and agentic systems inside complex enterprises — the real decisions, the tradeoffs, what actually worked. It's the conversation the industry needs right now.\" \nHosted by Matt Marshall and Sam Witteveen, the show delivers authentic, technically grounded conversations. No hype. No hand-waving. Just actionable lessons from those who’ve done it.\nSubscribe and listen\nThe first episode of Beyond the Pilot drops November 19 on VentureBeat.com and your favorite podcast platforms.\nSubscribe now to hear how top enterprises are turning AI ambition into action.\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube",
