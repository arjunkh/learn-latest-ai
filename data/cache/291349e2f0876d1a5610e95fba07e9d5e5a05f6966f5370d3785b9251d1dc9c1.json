However, just like a smart assistant needs to be kept secure, these technologies can expose retailers to new risks. It's important for everyday people to know that while shopping experiences may improve, their data security could be at stake.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rapid adoption of generative AI in retail indicates a growing user demand for innovative solutions. However, they must balance this with the need for cost-effective security measures to protect customer data. A practical implication is the necessity to invest in cybersecurity as a core part of product development.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the 95% adoption rate of generative AI in retail suggests a significant shift in infrastructure and application development. However, the report underscores the need for enhanced security protocols to mitigate risks associated with these technologies. Engineers should focus on building robust systems that can handle data securely while still leveraging the benefits of AI."
