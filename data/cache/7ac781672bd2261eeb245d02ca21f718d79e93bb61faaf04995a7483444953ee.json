  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.17041v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.",

  "speedrun": "A new study highlights security risks associated with Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), which use advanced AI for personalization and strategic reasoning. It points out that existing security frameworks, like OWASP, don't adequately address the unique vulnerabilities of these vehicles, particularly how threats can arise from different system layers. The research introduces a role-based architecture to analyze these risks, emphasizing that even minor disturbances can lead to significant safety issues. This is crucial as AgVs become more prevalent on our roads.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Consumers relying on AgVs could face safety risks if vulnerabilities are not addressed, as even minor issues could lead to major accidents.",
    "As the automotive industry shifts towards AI integration, understanding these risks could shape safety standards and regulatory frameworks."

    "eli12": "Agentic Vehicles, or AgVs, are cars that use smart AI to make decisions and personalize experiences. Think of them as personal assistants that also drive. However, the study shows they can be vulnerable to security threats, which could endanger passengers. As more people use these vehicles, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly important.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding the security risks of AgVs is vital. Users expect safe, reliable experiences, and any vulnerabilities could lead to serious consequences, impacting brand trust. This research highlights the need for robust security measures to protect against threats from various system layers.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces a role-based architecture for AgVs, focusing on the Personal Agent and Driving Strategy Agent. It identifies vulnerabilities not only in the agentic AI layer but also from upstream layers like perception and control. A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis demonstrate how minor distortions can escalate into unsafe behaviors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive security frameworks tailored for vehicle systems."
