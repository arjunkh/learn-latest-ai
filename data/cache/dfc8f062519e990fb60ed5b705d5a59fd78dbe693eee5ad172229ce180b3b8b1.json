    "eli12": "Running coding agents in parallel is like having several chefs in a kitchen, all working on different dishes at the same time. This teamwork can speed up the cooking process, just as it speeds up coding projects. For everyday people, this means software can be developed faster, leading to quicker updates and new features.",
    "pm": "For product managers, using parallel coding agents could meet user needs more efficiently by accelerating development cycles. This approach might lower costs associated with lengthy project timelines. A practical implication is that teams could deliver updates or new products more frequently, enhancing user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, running multiple coding agents can optimize resource allocation and task management. Key specifics include the ability to assign different coding tasks to each agent, potentially leading to a 30% increase in task completion rates. However, coordination between agents is crucial to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth progress."
