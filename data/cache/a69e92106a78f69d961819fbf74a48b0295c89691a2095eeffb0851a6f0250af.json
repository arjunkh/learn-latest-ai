  "speedrun": "The article discusses methods to enhance coding iteration speed, emphasizing the importance of local testing. By running tests locally, developers can quickly identify and fix issues without relying on external servers. This approach could significantly reduce the time spent on debugging and increase overall productivity. As coding demands grow, improving iteration speed is crucial for staying competitive in software development.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can save time and resources by testing locally, leading to faster project completion.",
    "This shift towards local testing reflects a broader trend in software development, prioritizing efficiency and speed."

    "eli12": "Improving coding speed means programmers can work faster and more efficiently. Think of it like practicing a sport in your backyard instead of waiting for a field. Local testing helps developers catch mistakes early, making life easier for everyone involved in a project.",
    "pm": "For product managers, faster coding iterations mean quicker feature rollouts and improved user satisfaction. By prioritizing local testing, teams could cut costs associated with debugging. This approach allows for more agile responses to user feedback.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, local testing can streamline the debugging process by allowing developers to run tests in real-time. This could lead to a noticeable reduction in iteration cycles. However, it's important to ensure that local environments mirror production settings to avoid discrepancies."
