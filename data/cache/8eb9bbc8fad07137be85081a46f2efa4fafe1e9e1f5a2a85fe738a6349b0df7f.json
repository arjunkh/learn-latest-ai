The design reduces latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains low resource requirements. Preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability performance. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-REDGIO-5-0/ci-component.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework for deploying AI on edge devices in Industry 5.0 has been introduced, focusing on local inference to cut down latency and eliminate the need for external data transfer. This agent-based design allows for flexibility, as individual agents handle specific tasks. Early tests in the food industry show faster deployment times and better adaptability. This development is significant as it could streamline AI integration in industrial settings, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could directly benefit industries relying on real-time data processing, allowing for quicker decision-making and operational efficiency.",
    "It signals a shift towards more autonomous and efficient industrial processes, emphasizing local processing capabilities that could reshape how industries deploy AI technology."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This new framework makes it easier to use AI on devices right where the action happens, like on factory floors. Imagine having a smart assistant that can make decisions instantly without needing to check in with a central computer. This approach could mean faster responses and less downtime, which is great for businesses and everyday consumers who rely on timely services.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a growing need for efficient, real-time AI solutions. By enabling local processing, companies could reduce costs associated with data transfer and latency. Practically, this means teams can focus on developing features that enhance user experience rather than worrying about backend delays.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this agent-based framework allows multiple AI models to operate on edge devices with minimal resource requirements. It emphasizes local inference, which can drastically reduce latency compared to traditional cloud-based solutions. Preliminary evaluations in the food industry suggest notable improvements in deployment time and adaptability, indicating a promising direction for edge AI applications."
