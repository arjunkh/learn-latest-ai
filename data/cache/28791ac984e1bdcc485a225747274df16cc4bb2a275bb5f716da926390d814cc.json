  "speedrun": "A new approach to fraud detection in graphs focuses on time-awareness to prevent data leaks. This method ensures that future information doesn't influence current decisions, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of fraud detection systems. By implementing time-aware techniques, organizations could enhance their ability to detect fraudulent activities without compromising sensitive data. This matters now as fraud becomes increasingly sophisticated and timely detection is essential for effective prevention.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations dealing with sensitive data can enhance their fraud detection capabilities, ensuring that decisions are based solely on historical data.",
    "This method represents a shift towards more secure and reliable fraud detection processes, reflecting a growing need for data integrity in financial systems."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to solve a mystery without knowing the ending. Time-aware graph fraud detection works similarly, ensuring that only past clues inform current decisions. This approach helps keep data safe and improves detection accuracy. It's important for everyone because it helps protect our financial transactions from fraud.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this method highlights a user need for secure fraud detection solutions. By reducing the risk of data leaks, companies could save costs associated with fraud losses. Implementing this could enhance user trust and retention, as customers value security.",
    "engineer": "This approach employs time-aware techniques to prevent data leakage by ensuring that future data does not influence current fraud detection decisions. It could involve using models that analyze past transactions without incorporating any future context. This method addresses a significant challenge in fraud detection, potentially improving accuracy and reliability."
