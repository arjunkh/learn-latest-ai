Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND) can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory writers ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity, redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL, omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced initial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870 pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2). Quality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap for targeted model improvements.",

  "speedrun": "A new study shows that the AutoIND platform, a large language model, can cut the time needed for drafting Investigational New Drug (IND) applications by about 97%. This means reducing initial drafting time from around 100 hours to just 3.7 hours for some reports. While the quality of drafts was generally good, there were noted deficiencies in clarity and emphasis. This matters now as it could speed up the drug approval process, benefiting both developers and patients.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Regulatory writers could save significant time, allowing them to focus on refining documents rather than drafting them from scratch.",
    "This development could signal a shift in how regulatory submissions are prepared, potentially changing industry standards for efficiency and quality."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The AutoIND platform helps write complex drug application documents much faster, like using a calculator for math instead of doing it by hand. This efficiency could mean quicker access to new medications for patients, making a real difference in healthcare.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, AutoIND presents a way to streamline the regulatory process, potentially reducing costs and speeding up time-to-market. Understanding user needs for quicker submissions could lead to better resource allocation and improved product timelines.",
    "engineer": "AutoIND demonstrated a remarkable reduction in drafting time for IND applications, dropping from approximately 100 hours to just 3.7 hours. While quality scores were 69.6% and 77.9% in two tests, it highlighted areas for improvement, such as clarity and emphasis, indicating that further model refinement is necessary."
