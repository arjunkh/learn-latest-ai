  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.18126v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.",

  "speedrun": "A new design for Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference aims to cut down on communication delays and improve hardware use. By using a tree structure instead of dense interaction graphs, this approach can reduce latency by up to 90% while keeping accuracy within 1% of traditional methods. This matters now because it could significantly enhance the efficiency of AI systems, making them faster and more responsive in real-world applications.",

    "eli12": "Think of this new design like organizing a team into smaller groups instead of having everyone talk at once. This way, communication flows better, and tasks get done faster. It matters to everyday people because faster AI can lead to smoother interactions in apps and services we use daily.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this design could meet user needs for speed without sacrificing quality. The reduced latency can lower operational costs and improve customer satisfaction. Practically, it suggests that integrating such efficient systems could enhance product performance significantly.",
    "engineer": "Technically, this approach leverages a hierarchical tree topology to minimize dense communication, which can lower latency drastically. The adaptive mechanism selectively skips agent invocations based on confidence signals, optimizing resource use. This method has shown to reduce end-to-end latency by up to 90% while maintaining accuracy, making it a strong candidate for advanced AI applications."
