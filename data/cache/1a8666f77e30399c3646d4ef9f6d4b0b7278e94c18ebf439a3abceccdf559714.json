  "raw_body": "arXiv:2602.12356v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Benchmarking has long served as a foundational practice in machine learning and, increasingly, in modern AI systems such as large language models, where shared tasks, metrics, and leaderboards offer a common basis for measuring progress and comparing approaches. As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework for adaptive utility-weighted benchmarking has been proposed to enhance how we evaluate AI systems, especially large language models. This approach recognizes the diverse contexts in which AI operates and aims to incorporate the varied priorities of different stakeholders. By using human-in-the-loop updates, the framework allows benchmarks to evolve while remaining stable and interpretable. This matters now as AI systems become more integrated into critical applications, necessitating more accountable evaluation methods.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This framework could help developers create AI systems that better align with user needs, enhancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.",
    "At a strategic level, it signals a shift towards more nuanced and flexible evaluation methods, potentially leading to more responsible AI deployment across industries."

    "eli12": "Think of benchmarking like a report card for AI systems, but instead of just grades, it considers the different subjects that matter to various people. This new framework aims to make that report card more reflective of real-life situations and what different users care about. It matters because it could lead to AI tools that are more helpful and relevant in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework could reshape how user needs are assessed in AI products. By integrating diverse stakeholder priorities into benchmarking, it might improve product alignment with market demands. The practical implication is that teams could develop more user-centric AI solutions, enhancing both satisfaction and performance.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this framework introduces a multilayer, adaptive network for benchmarking AI models, allowing for dynamic updates based on human feedback. It leverages conjoint-derived utilities to formalize stakeholder preferences, offering a more contextual evaluation approach. This could enhance the interpretability and stability of benchmarks, though it requires careful implementation to balance complexity with usability."
