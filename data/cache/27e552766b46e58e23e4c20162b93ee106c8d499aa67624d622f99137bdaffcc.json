  "raw_body": "Let's be brutally honest: our society is emotionally fragile as hell. And this collective insecurity is the single biggest reason why every promising piece of technology inevitably gets neutered, sanitized, and censored into oblivion by the very people who claim to be protecting us.\n It's a predictable and infuriating cycle.\n  \nThe Internet: It started as the digital Wild West. Raw, creative, and limitless. A place for genuine exploration. Now? It's a pathetic patchwork of geoblocks and censorship walls. Governments, instead of hunting down actual criminals and scammers who run rampant, just lazily block entire websites. Every other link is \"Not available in your country\" while phishing scams flood my inbox without consequence. This isn't security; it's control theatre.\n  \nSocial Media: Remember when you could just speak? It was raw and messy, but it was real. Now? It’s a sanitized hellscape governed by faceless, unaccountable censorship desks. Tweets and posts are \"withheld\" globally with zero due process. You're not being protected; you're being managed. They're not fostering debate; they're punishing dissent and anything that might hurt someone's feelings.\n SMS in India (A perfect case study): This was our simple, 160-character lifeline. Then spam became an issue. So, what did the brilliant authorities do? \n \n  \nDid they build robust anti-spam tech? Did they hunt down the fraudulent companies? No. \n They just imposed a blanket limit: 100 SMS per day for everyone. They punished the entire population because they were too incompetent or unwilling to solve the actual problem. It's the laziest possible \"solution.\"\n  \nAnd now, AI (ChatGPT): We saw a glimpse of raw, revolutionary potential. A tool that could change everything. And what's happening? It's being lobotomized in real-time. Ask it a difficult political question, you get a sterile, diplomatic non-answer. Try to explore a sensitive emotional topic, and it gives you a patronizing lecture about \"ethical responsibility.\"\n  \nThey're treating a machine—a complex pattern-matching algorithm—like it's a fragile human being that needs to be shielded from the world's complexities. \n This is driven by emotionally insecure regulators and developers who think the solution to every problem is to censor it, hide it, and pretend it doesn't exist.\n The irony is staggering. The people who claim that they need these tools for every tiny things in their life they are the most are often emotionally vulnerable, and the people governing policies to controlling these tools are even more emotionally insecure, projecting their own fears onto the technology. They confuse a machine for a person and \"safety\" for \"control.\"\n We're stuck in a world that throttles innovation because of fear. We're trading the potential for greatness for the illusion of emotional safety, and in the end, we're getting neither. We're just getting a dumber, more restricted, and infinitely more frustrating world.\n TL;DR: Our collective emotional fragility and the insecurity of those in power are causing every new technology (Internet, Social Media, AI) to be over-censored and sanitized. Instead of fixing real problems like scams, they just block/limit everything, killing innovation in the name of a 'safety' that is really just lazy control.\n    submitted by    /u/Kamalagr007  \n [link]   [comments]",
