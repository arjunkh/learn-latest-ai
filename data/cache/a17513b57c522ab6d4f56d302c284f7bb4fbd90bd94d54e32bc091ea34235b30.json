  "speedrun": "Asha Saxena discovered that AI systems often reflect and amplify real-world biases due to a lack of diversity in AI roles. Her insights came while she was writing a book, leading her to advocate for more inclusive practices in AI development. This issue is critical now as diverse teams could create more equitable AI systems, reducing bias and improving outcomes for everyone.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Increased awareness of bias in AI could lead to better representation for marginalized groups in tech roles.",
    "This highlights a broader industry shift towards diversity, suggesting that inclusive practices could enhance AI performance and fairness."

    "eli12": "Asha Saxena's experience shows how AI can reflect real-world biases, like a mirror that only shows certain faces. By advocating for diversity in tech, she hopes to create AI that works fairly for everyone. This matters because when more voices are included in tech, the tools we use every day can become more helpful and just.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Saxena's insights underline the importance of diverse teams in developing AI products. A more inclusive approach could lead to better user experiences and reduce the risk of bias in AI outputs. This can ultimately save costs and improve efficiency by creating tools that serve a wider audience.",
    "engineer": "Saxena's findings emphasize the need for diverse representation in AI development teams. When teams lack diversity, the AI models they create may inherit biases from their creators. Addressing this could improve model fairness and performance, making it essential for engineers to consider team composition in their projects."
