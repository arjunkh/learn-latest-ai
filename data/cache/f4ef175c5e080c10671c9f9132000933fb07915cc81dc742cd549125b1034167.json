    "eli12": "Tabular foundation models are like smart assistants for data analysis, helping to make sense of numbers and tables more easily. They can quickly find patterns in data that would take humans much longer to spot. This matters because it allows businesses to make better decisions faster, improving everything from marketing to product development.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of tabular foundation models means a more efficient way to analyze user data. These models could reduce costs by automating data tasks, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives. A practical implication is that companies might need to invest in training for these new tools to fully leverage their potential.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, tabular foundation models are built to handle structured data more effectively than previous methods. They often achieve higher accuracy and speed in tasks like classification and regression. Engineers should note that while these models show promise, they may require fine-tuning for specific datasets to maximize performance."
