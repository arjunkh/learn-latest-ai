  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.16288v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) arises from complex interactions among uncontrollable factors, controllable lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators, where relationships are often uncertain. Fuzzy subgraph connectivity (FSC) provides a systematic tool to capture such imprecision by quantifying the strength of association between vertices and subgraphs in fuzzy graphs. In this work, a fuzzy CHD graph is constructed with vertices for uncontrollable, controllable, and indicator components, and edges weighted by fuzzy memberships. Using FSC, we evaluate connectivity to identify strongest diagnostic routes, dominant risk factors, and critical bridges. Results show that FSC highlights influential pathways, bounds connectivity between weakest and strongest correlations, and reveals critical edges whose removal reduces predictive strength. Thus, FSC offers an interpretable and robust framework for modeling uncertainty in CHD risk prediction and supporting clinical decision-making.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces fuzzy subgraph connectivity (FSC) as a method to analyze coronary heart disease (CHD) by capturing uncertain relationships among various risk factors. By constructing a fuzzy CHD graph, researchers identified key diagnostic routes and influential pathways that impact risk prediction. Notably, removing certain connections can significantly reduce predictive strength. This approach could enhance clinical decision-making by providing clearer insights into complex disease interactions.",

    "eli12": "The study uses a new method called fuzzy subgraph connectivity to analyze coronary heart disease. Think of it like mapping a city where some roads are uncertain or unclear. By identifying important routes, doctors could make better decisions about treating patients. This is significant because it could lead to more effective and tailored healthcare solutions.",
    "pm": "For product managers in healthcare, this research highlights a growing need for tools that analyze complex health data. The FSC method could enhance the efficiency of risk assessment processes, making it easier to identify critical factors. A practical implication might be the development of software that integrates this fuzzy analysis for better patient outcomes.",
    "engineer": "The study employs fuzzy subgraph connectivity to model the interactions in coronary heart disease. By constructing a fuzzy graph with weighted edges, researchers can quantify the strength of associations among risk factors. This method allows for identifying critical connections that, if altered, could impact predictive accuracy. The findings suggest that focusing on these pathways could enhance risk prediction models."
