Using Excel, we explore how predictions rely entirely on the closest observations, why feature scaling matters, and how heterogeneous variables can make distances meaningless. Through examples with continuous and categorical features, including the California Housing and Diamonds datasets, we see the strengths and limitations of k-NN, and why defining the right distance is essential to reflect real-world structure.\nThe post The Machine Learning “Advent Calendar” Day 1: k-NN Regressor in Excel appeared first on Towards Data Science.",

  "speedrun": "The first day of the Machine Learning Advent Calendar highlights the k-NN regressor, a basic model that predicts outcomes based on the nearest data points. It emphasizes the importance of feature scaling and the challenges posed by mixed variable types. Using datasets like California Housing and Diamonds, the piece illustrates how defining distance correctly is crucial for accurate predictions. This matters now as understanding these fundamentals can enhance data analysis in various fields.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data analysts and students can immediately apply k-NN in Excel, improving their predictive modeling skills. This hands-on approach could boost their confidence and understanding.",
    "The introduction of simple models like k-NN reflects a broader trend towards accessible data science tools, making advanced analytics more approachable for non-experts."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "The k-NN regressor is like asking your neighbors for advice based on their experiences. It uses the closest examples to make predictions, but if your neighbors are very different, the advice might not fit. Learning this model helps everyday people understand how data can guide decisions in real life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the k-NN regressor offers a straightforward way to analyze user data without complex setups. Understanding user proximity can enhance targeted marketing strategies. The practical implication is that even basic models can yield valuable insights into customer behavior.",
    "engineer": "The k-NN regressor operates by calculating distances between data points, relying on the nearest neighbors for predictions. Key specifics include the importance of feature scaling to ensure distances are meaningful and the handling of heterogeneous variables. However, care must be taken in defining the right distance metric to avoid skewed results."
