    "eli12": "This article discusses how predicting humidity can help data centers use energy and water more efficiently. By comparing older methods like ARIMA with newer AI methods like N-BEATS, it shows that AI can be more accurate and easier to understand. This is important because it means data centers can save money and reduce their environmental impact, which affects everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this comparison highlights a user need for tools that not only predict but also explain their forecasts. AI models like N-BEATS could enhance efficiency, potentially lowering costs associated with energy and water. A practical implication is that incorporating these advanced forecasting methods could improve service offerings in resource-intensive sectors.",
    "engineer": "The article evaluates ARIMA against N-BEATS, showing that N-BEATS achieves higher accuracy in humidity forecasting while also being interpretable. This is significant as data centers require precise environmental controls to optimize performance. Engineers might consider adopting N-BEATS for its balance of accuracy and interpretability, which could lead to more sustainable operations."
