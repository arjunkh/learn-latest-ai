  "speedrun": "The article argues for the T-statistic as a more reliable measure than the z-score in certain statistical analyses. It highlights that the T-statistic accounts for smaller sample sizes and provides a more accurate representation of the data's variability. This is particularly important in fields where sample sizes are often limited. Understanding this distinction is crucial for researchers and analysts who rely on accurate data interpretation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers using small sample sizes will benefit from more accurate results, enhancing the validity of their findings.",
    "This shift towards the T-statistic could indicate a broader trend in statistical analysis, emphasizing precision over simplicity in data interpretation."

    "eli12": "Think of the T-statistic like a tailored suit, designed to fit specific situations better than a standard off-the-rack option, like the z-score. It provides a more accurate picture when working with smaller groups. This matters because better statistical tools lead to more reliable conclusions in everyday research and decision-making.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the T-statistic means recognizing when to apply it over the z-score, especially with limited user data. This could improve product testing outcomes and lead to more informed decisions. It emphasizes the need for precision in analytics, ensuring that insights are based on robust statistical methods.",
    "engineer": "The T-statistic is particularly useful when sample sizes are small, as it relies on the sample standard deviation rather than the population standard deviation, which the z-score uses. This makes the T-statistic more adaptable to real-world scenarios where data is often limited. Engineers should consider this when developing algorithms that rely on statistical methods for analysis."
