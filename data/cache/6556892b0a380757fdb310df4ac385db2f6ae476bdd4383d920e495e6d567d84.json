The retailer is generating new images of real models in various outfits using existing photoshoots. This approach not only streamlines the image creation process but also keeps human models in the loop. As AI becomes more integrated into retail, it could redefine how brands present their products.",

    "eli12": "Zara is using AI to create new images of models in different outfits, which could save time and resources. Imagine a painter who can instantly create variations of their artwork without starting from scratch. This matters because it could lead to more diverse fashion representation and faster product launches for everyday shoppers.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Zara's AI approach highlights a user need for quicker and more varied product presentations. This could reduce costs associated with photoshoots and improve efficiency. A practical implication is that brands might need to rethink their marketing strategies to incorporate AI-generated content effectively.",
    "engineer": "Zara is leveraging generative AI to produce images by processing existing photoshoots, which could enhance visual content creation. This method likely involves advanced models capable of understanding and replicating human features and clothing styles. However, the reliance on existing images means that the quality of output will depend on the diversity of the input data."
