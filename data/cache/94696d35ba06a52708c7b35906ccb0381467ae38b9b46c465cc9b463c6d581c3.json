  "raw_body": "arXiv:2508.18380v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which, at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.",

  "speedrun": "A new approach called Template-based Active Feature Acquisition (TAFA) has been proposed to improve how AI systems decide which features to acquire before making predictions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on complex reinforcement learning or greedy strategies, TAFA learns a library of feature templates that are jointly informative. This innovation not only simplifies the decision-making process but also lowers costs and computation. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through experiments on various datasets, making it a significant advancement in the field.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could lead to more efficient AI systems for industries relying on data-driven decision-making, reducing costs for developers and users alike.",
    "TAFA represents a shift towards more adaptable AI models that can operate effectively without extensive prior knowledge of data distributions."

    "eli12": "Think of TAFA like a chef who knows a few great recipes instead of trying to remember every ingredient for every dish. By using a set of templates, it makes choosing what to cook easier and faster. For everyday people, this means that AI could become more efficient at providing insights and predictions without needing as much data upfront.",
    "pm": "For product managers, TAFA could streamline feature acquisition processes, making it easier to develop AI products that are both cost-effective and efficient. By reducing the complexity of feature selection, teams can focus on delivering better user experiences without overspending on data acquisition. This approach may also enhance the speed of product iterations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, TAFA addresses the limitations of existing methods by utilizing a library of feature templates, which reduces the action space for feature selection. This means engineers can implement a more efficient algorithm that requires less computation and avoids estimating complex data distributions. The results from experiments show that TAFA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, indicating its potential for real-world applications."
