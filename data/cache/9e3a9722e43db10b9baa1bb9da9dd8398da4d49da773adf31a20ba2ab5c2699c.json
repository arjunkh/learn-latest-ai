  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.20679v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.",

  "speedrun": "Recent research explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve hyperbolic embeddings for hierarchical data structures. The study found that LLM-guided restructuring of hierarchies led to better embedding quality across 16 different cases. Key factors for optimal embeddings include a high branching factor and single inheritance. This matters now as it could enhance machine learning applications, from recommendation systems to computer vision, by making them more efficient and effective.",

    "eli12": "This study shows that LLMs can help organize hierarchical data better. Think of it like a librarian who can rearrange books to make finding information easier. This matters because clearer data organization can lead to smarter AI tools that help us in daily tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights a user need for better data organization in applications. By leveraging LLMs, teams could reduce costs associated with manual restructuring and improve the efficiency of their systems. A practical implication is that products could become more intuitive and responsive to user needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies to enhance hyperbolic embeddings. The experiments showed consistent improvements across standard quality metrics, indicating that LLMs can adapt hierarchies for better performance. However, the research emphasizes the importance of a high branching factor and single inheritance for optimal results."
