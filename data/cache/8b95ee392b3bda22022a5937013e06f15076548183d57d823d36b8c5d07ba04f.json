  "raw_body": "The race to deploy agentic AI is on. Across the enterprise, systems that can plan, take actions and collaborate across business applications promise unprecedented efficiency. But in the rush to automate, a critical component is being overlooked: Scalable security. We are building a workforce of digital employees without giving them a secure way to log in, access data and do their jobs without creating catastrophic risk.\nThe fundamental problem is that traditional identity and access management (IAM) designed for humans breaks at agentic scale. Controls like static roles, long-lived passwords and one-time approvals are useless when non-human identities can outnumber human ones by 10 to one. To harness the power of agentic AI, identity must evolve from a simple login gatekeeper into the dynamic control plane for your entire AI operation.\n“The fastest path to responsible AI is to avoid real data. Use synthetic data to prove value, then earn the right to touch the real thing.” — Shawn Kanungo, keynote speaker and innovation strategist; bestselling author of The Bold Ones\nWhy your human-centric IAM is a sitting duck\nAgentic AI does not just use software; it behaves like a user. It authenticates to systems, assumes roles and calls APIs. If you treat these agents as mere features of an application, you invite invisible privilege creep and untraceable actions. A single over-permissioned agent can exfiltrate data or trigger erroneous business processes at machine speed, with no one the wiser until it is too late.\nThe static nature of legacy IAM is the core vulnerability. You cannot pre-define a fixed role for an agent whose tasks and required data access might change daily. The only way to keep access decisions accurate is to move policy enforcement from a one-time grant to a continuous, runtime evaluation.\nProve value before production data\nKanungo’s guidance offers a practical on-ramp. Start with synthetic or masked datasets to validate agent workflows, scopes and guardrails. Once your policies, logs and break-glass paths hold up in this sandbox, you can graduate agents to real data with confidence and clear audit evidence.\nBuilding an identity-centric operating model for AI\nSecuring this new workforce requires a shift in mindset. Each AI agent must be treated as a first-class citizen within your identity ecosystem.\nFirst, every agent needs a unique, verifiable identity. This is not just a technical ID; it must be linked to a human owner, a specific business use case and a software bill of materials (SBOM). The era of shared service accounts is over; they are the equivalent of giving a master key to a faceless crowd.\nSecond, replace set-and-forget roles with session-based, risk-aware permissions. Access should be granted just in time, scoped to the immediate task and the minimum necessary dataset, then automatically revoked when the job is complete. Think of it as giving an agent a key to a single room for one meeting, not the master key to the entire building.\nThree pillars of a scalable agent security architecture\nContext-aware authorization at the core. Authorization can no longer be a simple yes or no at the door. It must be a continuous conversation. Systems should evaluate context in real time. Is the agent’s digital posture attested? Is it requesting data typical for its purpose? Is this access occurring during a normal operational window? This dynamic evaluation enables both security and speed.\nPurpose-bound data access at the edge. The final line of defense is the data layer itself. By embedding policy enforcement directly into the data query engine, you can enforce row-level and column-level security based on the agent’s declared purpose. A customer service agent should be automatically blocked from running a query that appears designed for financial analysis. Purpose binding ensures data is used as intended, not merely accessed by an authorized identity.\nTamper-evident evidence by default. In a world of autonomous actions, auditability is non-negotiable. Every access decision, data query and API call should be immutably logged, capturing the who, what, where and why. Link logs so they are tamper evident and replayable for auditors or incident responders, providing a clear narrative of every agent’s activities.\nA practical roadmap to get started\nBegin with an identity inventory. Catalog all non-human identities and service accounts. You will likely find sharing and over-provisioning. Begin issuing unique identities for each agent workload.\nPilot a just-in-time access platform. Implement a tool that grants short-lived, scoped credentials for a specific project. This proves the concept and shows the operational benefits.\nMandate short-lived credentials. Issue tokens that expire in minutes, not months. Seek out and remove static API keys and secrets from code and configuration.\nStand up a synthetic data sandbox. Validate agent workflows, scopes, prompts and policies on synthetic or masked data first. Promote to real data only after controls, logs and egress policies pass.\nConduct an agent incident tabletop drill. Practice responses to a leaked credential, a prompt injection or a tool escalation. Prove you can revoke access, rotate credentials and isolate an agent in minutes.\nThe bottom line\nYou cannot manage an agentic, AI-driven future with human-era identity tools. The organizations that will win recognize identity as the central nervous system for AI operations. Make identity the control plane, move authorization to runtime, bind data access to purpose and prove value on synthetic data before touching the real thing. Do that, and you can scale to a million agents without scaling your breach risk.\n Michelle Buckner is a former NASA Information System Security Officer (ISSO). \nRead more from our guest writers.

  "speedrun": "The deployment of agentic AI in enterprises is rapidly advancing, but security measures are lagging behind. Traditional identity and access management (IAM) systems fail to accommodate the scale and dynamic nature of these AI agents, which can outnumber human workers by tenfold. This oversight could lead to significant security risks, as over-permissioned agents may act without oversight. Addressing this issue is crucial for harnessing the full potential of AI while maintaining security.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations using AI agents could face immediate security vulnerabilities without proper identity controls, risking data breaches and operational failures.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend in the market toward more sophisticated security frameworks that can support the growing use of AI technology across industries."

    "eli12": "As businesses embrace AI that can act like humans, they need to rethink how they manage access and security. Imagine giving a digital employee a key that only works for a specific task, rather than a master key to everything. This approach could help prevent unauthorized access and keep sensitive data safe, making it important for everyone involved in AI operations.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this means recognizing that traditional IAM systems won't suffice for AI agents. Users need efficient access controls that adapt to changing tasks and minimize risk. Implementing just-in-time access and unique identities for each agent could streamline operations while enhancing security, ultimately leading to more reliable AI deployments.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the article emphasizes the need for a dynamic authorization framework that continuously evaluates agent access based on context. Traditional static roles are inadequate, as agent tasks can shift rapidly. Implementing session-based permissions, context-aware authorization, and embedding security directly into data queries are key strategies for mitigating risks associated with agentic AI."
