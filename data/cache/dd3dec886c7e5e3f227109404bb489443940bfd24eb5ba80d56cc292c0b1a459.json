This trend complicates patient-doctor interactions and can lead to misdiagnosis. For example, individuals may believe they have serious conditions based on misleading information found online. This matters now as it highlights the need for better communication and education in healthcare to counter misinformation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Patients may feel more empowered but could also misinterpret their symptoms, leading to unnecessary anxiety and misdiagnosis.",

    "eli12": "Many people now research their health online, which can lead to confusion and fear. Imagine thinking you have a serious illness just because of something you read. It’s important to talk to doctors who can provide accurate information and reassurance.",
    "pm": "For product managers in health tech, understanding how misinformation affects patient behavior is crucial. There’s a clear user need for tools that help patients navigate their health inquiries accurately. This could lead to developing apps that provide reliable information and connect users with healthcare professionals.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the rise of health misinformation calls for advanced algorithms to filter credible sources from unreliable ones. Machine learning models could be trained to assess the reliability of health-related content online. However, ensuring these models are unbiased and effective remains a significant challenge."
