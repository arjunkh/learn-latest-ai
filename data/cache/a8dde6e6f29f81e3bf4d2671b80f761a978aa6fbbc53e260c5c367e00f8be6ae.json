  "speedrun": "Organizations often face a 'data-rich, action-poor' dilemma, where raw data can create misleading trends, much like the scintillating grid optical illusion. To combat this, the concept of data humanization is emerging, emphasizing the transformation of abstract metrics into actionable narratives. This shift calls for new roles, such as 'Data Artisans,' and a focus on demonstrating the financial impact of clearer insights. Understanding data in this way is crucial for making informed decisions today.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Data humanization could help teams make better decisions by translating complex numbers into relatable stories, making insights more accessible.",
    "This trend indicates a broader shift in how organizations approach data, prioritizing clarity and actionable insights over sheer volume."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Think of data humanization like turning a complicated recipe into a simple cooking guide. It helps people understand what the data means and why it matters. This approach makes it easier for everyone to grasp important insights, ultimately helping us make smarter choices in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers, data humanization highlights the need to connect metrics with user experiences. By focusing on storytelling, it could enhance user engagement and improve decision-making. This approach may also reduce costs associated with misinterpretation and wasted efforts on irrelevant data.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, data humanization emphasizes the importance of transforming raw data into meaningful narratives. It suggests incorporating roles like 'Data Artisans' to bridge the gap between analytics and actionable insights. This could lead to better ROI as organizations leverage clearer data interpretations for strategic decisions."
