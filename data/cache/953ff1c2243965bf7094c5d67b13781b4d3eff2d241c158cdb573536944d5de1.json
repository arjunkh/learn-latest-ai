  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.16969v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)-the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains-remains lacking. We present an operational SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) and operationalize it via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have proposed a new framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI), which refers to AI's ability to autonomously engage in scientific inquiry. Their model includes four key tasks and evaluates over 1,000 examples from various scientific fields. Results show significant gaps, such as low accuracy in deep research and challenges in multimodal reasoning. This work is crucial as it lays the groundwork for AI systems that could actively contribute to scientific discoveries.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could enhance the capabilities of researchers by providing AI tools that assist in complex scientific tasks, potentially speeding up discovery processes.",
    "The introduction of a structured evaluation framework signals a shift towards more effective AI applications in science, influencing how AI is integrated into research methodologies."

    "eli12": "Think of Scientific General Intelligence as a smart assistant that helps scientists explore new ideas and conduct experiments. The new framework outlines how AI can be evaluated on tasks like deep research and experiments. This matters because it could lead to AI that not only supports scientists but actively helps them discover new knowledge.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a user need for AI tools that can assist in scientific research. The focus on practical tasks indicates a potential market for AI solutions that enhance research efficiency. Companies could explore developing AI that not only retrieves information but also generates novel hypotheses.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces a Practical Inquiry Model (PIM) and a benchmark called SGI-Bench, which evaluates LLMs on tasks like deep research and experimental reasoning. Key findings include a low exact match rate of 10-20% in deep research and challenges in executing wet protocols. The introduction of Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) aims to improve hypothesis novelty during inference, enhancing AI's role in scientific discovery."
