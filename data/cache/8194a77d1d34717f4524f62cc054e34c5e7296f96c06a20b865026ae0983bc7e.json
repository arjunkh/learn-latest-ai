    "eli12": "Some AI companies are focusing on creating systems that work best for specific fields, like healthcare or finance. Think of it like a tailor making a suit just for you, rather than a one-size-fits-all outfit. This approach could help businesses solve problems more effectively and improve their services.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend suggests a growing user demand for specialized AI solutions. It could lead to reduced costs and improved performance by addressing specific industry challenges. As a result, focusing on vertical AI could create new opportunities for product differentiation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, vertical AI systems often utilize specialized models that are optimized for particular tasks within an industry. This contrasts with horizontal models that aim for general applicability. Engineers might find that these tailored systems can achieve better performance metrics, as they are designed with specific data and use cases in mind."
