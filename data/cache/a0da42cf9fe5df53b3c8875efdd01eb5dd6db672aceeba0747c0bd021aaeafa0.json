    "eli12": "Europe is trying different ways to teach AI skills to help businesses find the talent they need. Think of it like a garden: if there aren’t enough plants (skills), the garden (business) can’t thrive. This is important because as more jobs require AI skills, better education could help everyone succeed.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding the AI talent gap is crucial. As demand for AI skills grows, finding qualified candidates could become more expensive and competitive. Investing in AI education initiatives may help build a more skilled workforce, ultimately benefiting product development and innovation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the OECD's findings underscore the urgent need for educational programs that focus on AI competencies. With demand outpacing supply, businesses may need to invest in training initiatives or partnerships with educational institutions. This could lead to a more skilled workforce capable of leveraging advanced AI models effectively."
