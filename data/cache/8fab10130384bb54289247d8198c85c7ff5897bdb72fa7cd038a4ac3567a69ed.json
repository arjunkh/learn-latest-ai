  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.13979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context. However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation. While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific presentation.\n  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset, resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%, across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline model.",

    "eli12": "This research shows that using both sound and visuals can make speech recognition smarter. Think of it like having a friend who not only listens to you but also looks at your notes. This could help everyone, especially in settings like lectures or meetings, where understanding complex ideas is crucial.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research underscores the importance of multi-modal features in enhancing user experience. By integrating visual aids like slides into ASR systems, products could meet user needs more effectively while potentially reducing costs associated with errors in transcription. This might open new avenues for applications in education and business.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces a benchmark for multi-modal ASR, focusing on the integration of presentation slides alongside audio data. By employing data augmentation techniques, the researchers trained a model that achieved a 34% reduction in word error rates. This demonstrates the potential of combining different data types to improve the accuracy of speech recognition systems, particularly in specialized domains."
