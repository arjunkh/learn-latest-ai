  "speedrun": "In 2025, the tech industry is witnessing a shift from 'vibe coding' to 'context engineering' in software development. This change highlights AI's evolving role, where it is being tested against human engineers. While AI started strong, the complexity of context engineering emphasizes the need for nuanced understanding in coding. This matters now as it reflects the ongoing competition and collaboration between AI and human technologists.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Software developers must adapt to new tools and methodologies, affecting their workflows and skills. This transition could redefine roles in tech teams.",
    "The shift to context engineering indicates a broader trend of AI becoming more integrated into complex tasks, influencing market dynamics and job structures."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Think of vibe coding like painting with broad strokes, while context engineering is more like detailed sculpture work. This change means that AI is learning to understand the deeper meanings behind tasks, making it more useful for developers. For everyday people, this could lead to better software that meets their needs more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this shift highlights the need to understand how AI can enhance user experience through context-aware features. It could mean re-evaluating product strategies to incorporate AI's nuanced capabilities, potentially leading to more efficient development processes and cost savings.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the transition to context engineering involves AI models that can interpret and utilize contextual information in coding tasks. This may require advanced natural language processing techniques and improved data handling capabilities. However, the complexity of context engineering presents challenges that AI must overcome to match human intuition and creativity."
