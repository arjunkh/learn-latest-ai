  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.20048v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.",

  "speedrun": "A new system called Insight Agents (IA) aims to help E-commerce sellers by providing personalized data insights through a multi-agent setup. This system, built on a plan-and-execute model, has shown a 90% accuracy rate and a response time of under 15 seconds. By automating information retrieval, IA could simplify decision-making for sellers, potentially boosting their productivity. This development is crucial as it addresses significant challenges in navigating complex data landscapes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "E-commerce sellers can now access tailored insights quickly, reducing the time spent on data analysis and decision-making.",
    "The introduction of IA reflects a growing trend toward automation in E-commerce, indicating a shift in how businesses leverage data for strategic advantage."

    "eli12": "Insight Agents are like having a smart assistant that helps online sellers sift through data to find useful insights. By automating this process, sellers can make faster decisions without getting bogged down in information overload. This matters because it allows everyday sellers to focus more on growing their business rather than getting lost in data.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Insight Agents highlight a growing need for tools that simplify complex data for users. By reducing the effort sellers spend on data analysis, this system could enhance user satisfaction and drive adoption. A practical implication is that PMs might consider integrating similar automated features to streamline user experiences.",
    "engineer": "Technically, Insight Agents utilize a hierarchical multi-agent structure with a manager and two worker agents, optimizing for accuracy and latency. The manager employs a lightweight encoder-decoder model for Out-of-Domain detection, while worker agents break down queries for more precise responses. This approach achieved a 90% accuracy rate with a P90 latency under 15 seconds, showcasing effective real-time data processing."
