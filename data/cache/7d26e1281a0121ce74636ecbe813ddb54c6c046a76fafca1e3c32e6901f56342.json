This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\\\"obaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study on Large Language Models (LLMs) explored how their hallucinations—plausible but incorrect outputs—affect user trust. With 192 participants, researchers found that rather than causing blanket mistrust, hallucinations led to context-sensitive trust calibration. Key factors influencing this trust included user expertise and perceived risk. Understanding these dynamics is crucial now as LLMs become more integrated into daily life and decision-making processes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Users relying on LLMs for information could adjust their trust based on context, enhancing decision-making. This means users might weigh their expertise and the stakes of their decisions when interacting with LLMs.",
    "The findings suggest a shift in how organizations might approach LLM deployment, emphasizing the need for context-aware trust strategies as LLMs are increasingly adopted across industries."

    "eli12": "This study looks at how people trust AI when it makes mistakes. Instead of losing trust completely, users adjust their trust based on the situation. Think of it like a friend who sometimes gives bad advice; you might still trust them in areas where they excel. This matters because as AI tools become common, understanding how to trust them is important for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research highlights the importance of user context in trust-building with LLMs. Users might be more forgiving of errors if they feel knowledgeable about the topic. This suggests that improving user education and providing context-sensitive feedback could enhance user trust and engagement with LLMs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study validates the recursive trust calibration process, emphasizing user-related factors like expertise and intuition in trust dynamics. It also highlights the need for LLMs to account for perceived risk and decision stakes in their outputs. This could lead to improvements in model design that prioritize contextual awareness and user feedback."
