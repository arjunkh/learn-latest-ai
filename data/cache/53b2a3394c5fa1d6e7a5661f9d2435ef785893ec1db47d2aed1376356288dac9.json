  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.15292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose an automated pipeline for performing literature reviews using semantic similarity. Unlike traditional systematic review systems or optimization based methods, this work emphasizes minimal overhead and high relevance by using transformer based embeddings and cosine similarity. By providing a paper title and abstract, it generates relevant keywords, fetches relevant papers from open access repository, and ranks them based on their semantic closeness to the input. Three embedding models were evaluated. A statistical thresholding approach is then applied to filter relevant papers, enabling an effective literature review pipeline. Despite the absence of heuristic feedback or ground truth relevance labels, the proposed system shows promise as a scalable and practical tool for preliminary research and exploratory analysis.",

  "speedrun": "A new automated pipeline for literature reviews uses semantic similarity to streamline the process. It employs transformer-based embeddings and cosine similarity to quickly identify relevant papers from a title and abstract. This method minimizes overhead while maintaining high relevance, making it a promising tool for preliminary research. As the demand for efficient literature reviews grows, this system could significantly enhance researchers' productivity.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers could benefit immediately, as the tool simplifies finding relevant literature without extensive manual searching.",
    "This approach signals a shift in academic research methods, moving towards more automated and efficient processes in literature reviews."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This new tool helps researchers find important papers quickly by understanding the meaning behind titles and abstracts. Think of it like a smart librarian who knows exactly which books relate to your topic. It matters because it saves time and effort, allowing people to focus more on their actual research.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this tool addresses the user need for efficient literature reviews by reducing the time spent on manual searches. It could lower costs associated with research by automating the process. A practical implication is that teams can quickly gather and assess relevant literature, speeding up project timelines.",
    "engineer": "The pipeline uses transformer-based embeddings and cosine similarity, evaluating three different models to rank relevant papers based on semantic closeness. It applies a statistical thresholding method to filter results, enhancing its effectiveness without requiring ground truth relevance labels. This approach could improve the scalability of literature reviews in research."
