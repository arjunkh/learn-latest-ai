    "eli12": "Scientists have found a way to create a mini-version of a uterus in the lab, allowing them to study how embryos develop. Imagine a tiny science experiment that helps us understand how babies begin to grow. This matters because it could help people who want to have children but are struggling to do so.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in healthcare, this research highlights a growing need for innovative fertility solutions. Understanding embryo development in lab settings could lead to more effective products that assist in conception. This could also open new markets focused on reproductive health technologies.",
    "engineer": "The study employs advanced organoid technology to replicate uterine conditions, allowing for real-time observation of embryo implantation. Key specifics include the ability to analyze cellular interactions and developmental milestones in a controlled environment. This method could significantly enhance our understanding of human reproductive biology."
