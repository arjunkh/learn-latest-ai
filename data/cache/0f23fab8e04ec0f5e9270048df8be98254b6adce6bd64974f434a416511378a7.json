  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.26854v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework has been introduced to enhance scientific reasoning by creating a verifiable knowledge base called SciencePedia. This system generates around 3 million first-principles questions and synthesizes verified scientific content into approximately 200,000 entries across various disciplines. The approach significantly improves knowledge density and reduces factual errors compared to traditional methods. This matters now as it could reshape how scientific knowledge is accessed and verified.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers and students could benefit from clearer, verifiable scientific reasoning, making it easier to validate concepts and enhance learning.",
    "This framework signals a shift toward more transparent and reliable scientific communication, potentially transforming educational resources and research methodologies."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "This new system aims to clarify scientific reasoning by breaking down complex ideas into understandable parts. Imagine it as a detailed recipe that not only lists ingredients but also explains each step. This matters because it could help everyone, from students to professionals, trust and understand scientific information better.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework addresses the user need for reliable and understandable scientific content. It could lower costs associated with misinformation and improve efficiency in knowledge retrieval. A practical implication is the potential for developing educational tools that leverage this verified encyclopedia to enhance user learning experiences.",
    "engineer": "The framework utilizes a Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base, generating 3 million questions and synthesizing 200,000 entries across multiple disciplines. It employs independent solver models to ensure high fidelity, filtering outputs through prompt sanitization and consensus checks. This could lead to more accurate and reliable scientific content generation, though engineers should remain aware of the scalability challenges in maintaining such a vast database."
