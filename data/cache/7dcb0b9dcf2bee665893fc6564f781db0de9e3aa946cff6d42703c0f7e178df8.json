    "eli12": "The AI Expo highlighted how AI is moving from just doing tasks to becoming a smarter helper. Think of it like a car that drives itself instead of just being a tool to get you from point A to B. This matters because it could make work easier and more efficient for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift means focusing on building systems that can intelligently manage data and governance. By enhancing AI's capabilities, they could meet user needs for more efficient workflows. This could lead to reduced costs and improved user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the expo emphasized the need for infrastructure that supports agentic systems, which operate autonomously. Key discussions included the importance of data readiness and governance frameworks to enable these systems. Without these, the potential of AI as a digital co-worker may not be fully realized."
