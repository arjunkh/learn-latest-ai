    "eli12": "Think of supply chain management like a busy restaurant kitchen. Each dish requires precise timing and coordination. Data scientists can help improve this process by analyzing data to predict busy times and optimize ingredient use. This matters to everyone because better supply chains can lead to lower prices and improved product availability.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the rise of data science in supply chains means a greater focus on efficiency and customer satisfaction. By leveraging data, teams can anticipate market demands and reduce waste. This could lead to cost savings and improved product delivery timelines, enhancing overall competitiveness.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, supply chain data science may involve predictive modeling and optimization algorithms. With the increasing volume of data from IoT devices and logistics platforms, engineers could develop models that improve demand forecasting accuracy. However, challenges like data integration and real-time analytics remain critical considerations."
