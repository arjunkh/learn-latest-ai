    "eli12": "Imagine having a digital assistant that only helps you with what you allow it to see. This new blueprint lets users create their own chatbots that can search through personal files safely. It matters because it gives people more control over their information and how it's used.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this self-hosted chatbot model addresses a growing user need for privacy and control. It could reduce costs associated with data breaches and compliance issues. The practical implication is that companies might need to adapt their offerings to include self-hosted options to meet user expectations.",
    "engineer": "The proposed platform allows each user to have a personal chatbot capable of vector-searching through authorized files. This autonomy in searching enhances efficiency and user experience. However, developers should consider the complexities of managing permissions and ensuring robust security measures."
