    "eli12": "Quantum computing is like having a super-fast calculator that can solve complex problems much quicker than regular ones. It could help in areas like predicting weather patterns or improving healthcare. This is important for everyday people because faster data processing can lead to better services and solutions in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, quantum computing could mean developing products that leverage faster algorithms for data analysis. This could improve user experiences by providing quicker responses and insights. It's essential to consider how this technology might reduce operational costs or enhance efficiency in the long run.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, quantum machine learning utilizes quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations that classical bits can't efficiently handle. For example, quantum algorithms like Grover's or Shor's could drastically reduce the time needed for specific computations. However, practical implementation still faces challenges, such as error rates and qubit coherence times."
