    "eli12": "Deloitte's report shows that companies are launching AI tools faster than they can ensure safety. Imagine a car being sold without brakes; it could lead to accidents. This matters to everyday people because it raises questions about how their data is being used and protected.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this report emphasizes the need to prioritize safety measures alongside product development. As user needs evolve, balancing innovation with risk management becomes crucial. A practical implication is that teams may need to allocate resources to develop robust safety protocols before launching new AI features.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Deloitte's findings underscore the urgency for integrating safety frameworks into AI development. The report reveals that agentic systems are rapidly moving from pilot to production, challenging traditional risk controls. Engineers might need to rethink their approaches to include real-time monitoring and adaptive safety measures to mitigate potential risks."
