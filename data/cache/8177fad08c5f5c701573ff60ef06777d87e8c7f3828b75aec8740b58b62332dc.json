  "speedrun": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at processing unstructured data, but they may not fully leverage the potential of structured data. The article highlights that while LLMs are popular, businesses could be missing out on valuable insights locked within their structured datasets. This distinction is crucial as companies look to optimize their data strategies and harness AI effectively.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses relying heavily on LLMs might overlook valuable insights in structured data, impacting decision-making processes.",
    "The shift towards understanding the limitations of LLMs indicates a broader trend in AI, where companies are exploring tailored solutions for specific data types."

    "eli12": "LLMs are like talented writers who shine with stories but might not be great with numbers and charts. They can help with lots of text but might miss important details in structured data like spreadsheets. This matters because businesses need to know where to use LLMs and where to look for other tools to get the best insights.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding that LLMs aren't a universal tool is key. It highlights the need to evaluate user needs carefully and consider how structured data can offer insights that LLMs might miss. This could lead to more efficient decision-making and product development strategies.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, LLMs are optimized for natural language processing but may not perform well with structured data analysis. The article suggests that companies should consider alternative AI approaches designed specifically for structured datasets, which could enhance data utilization. This insight is valuable for engineers looking to build more effective data solutions."
