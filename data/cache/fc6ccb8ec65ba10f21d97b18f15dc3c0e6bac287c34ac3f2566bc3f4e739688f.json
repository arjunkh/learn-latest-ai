How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have developed a computational model that mimics how humans learn from both language and experience. This model uses a pretrained language framework to analyze advice sharing and decision-making. In experiments across 10 video games, it was shown that linguistic guidance can enhance learning by minimizing risks and accelerating key discoveries. This matters now as it could pave the way for more effective AI systems that learn collaboratively with humans.",

    "eli12": "Imagine learning to ride a bike by listening to a friend while also practicing. This new model helps AI learn in a similar way, combining advice and hands-on experience. It matters because it could help AI systems become better at learning from us, making them more useful in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this model highlights the importance of integrating user feedback and guidance into product development. It suggests that AI tools could become more adaptive and efficient by learning from user interactions. This could lead to better user experiences and faster product iterations.",
    "engineer": "The model employs joint probabilistic inference to blend sensorimotor data with linguistic input, enhancing decision-making processes. Key findings from simulations indicate that linguistic guidance significantly reduces risky actions while accelerating learning. This approach could inform the design of AI systems capable of collaborative learning with humans."
