  "raw_body": "arXiv:2601.00023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Efficient workload assignment to the workforce is critical in last-mile package delivery systems. In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.",

  "speedrun": "A new study presents a multi-algorithm approach to balance workloads among delivery workers in urban last-mile delivery systems. Traditional methods often lead to uneven workloads, but this approach optimizes delivery assignments based on both distance and effort. By employing various algorithms, including k-means and evolutionary methods, the system aims for equitable work distribution. This is significant now as efficient delivery systems are crucial for meeting rising consumer expectations in urban areas.",

    "eli12": "This research looks at how to make delivery jobs fairer by balancing the amount of work each driver has. Instead of just sending drivers to the nearest packages, it considers how much effort each delivery takes. Imagine a team of runners where everyone should finish at the same time, not just the fastest. This matters because happy workers can lead to better service for customers.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, this study highlights the need to rethink delivery assignment strategies. By ensuring workers have balanced workloads, companies could improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. One practical implication could be integrating these algorithms into existing delivery management systems to enhance performance and worker satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "The proposed multi-algorithm approach combines various techniques, including k-means clustering and evolutionary algorithms, to optimize package assignments based on distance and workload. This methodology addresses significant workload imbalance, demonstrated through real-world applications in Azuqueca de Henares, Spain. By considering both delivery points and worker locations, the system aims to enhance operational efficiency and delivery times."
