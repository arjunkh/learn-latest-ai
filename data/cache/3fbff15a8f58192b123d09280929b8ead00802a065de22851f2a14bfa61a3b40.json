  "raw_body": "For the last two years, the fundamental unit of generative AI development has been the \"completion.\" \nYou send a text prompt to a model, it sends text back, and the transaction ends. If you want to continue the conversation, you have to send the entire history back to the model again. This \"stateless\" architecture—embodied by Google's legacy generateContent endpoint—was perfect for simple chatbots. But as developers move toward autonomous agents that use tools, maintain complex states, and \"think\" over long horizons, that stateless model has become a distinct bottleneck.\nLast week, Google DeepMind finally addressed this infrastructure gap with the public beta launch of the Interactions API (/interactions).\nWhile OpenAI began this shift back in March 2025 with its Responses API, Google’s entry signals its own efforts to advance the state-of-the-art. The Interactions API is not just a state management tool; it is a unified interface designed to treat LLMs less like text generators and more like remote operating systems.\nThe 'Remote Compute' Model\nThe core innovation of the Interactions API is the introduction of server-side state as a default behavior.\nPreviously, a developer building a complex agent had to manually manage a growing JSON list of every \"user\" and \"model\" turn, sending megabytes of history back and forth with every request. With the new API, developers simply pass a previous_interaction_id. Google’s infrastructure retains the conversation history, tool outputs, and \"thought\" processes on their end.\n\"Models are becoming systems and over time, might even become agents themselves,\" wrote DeepMind's Ali Çevik and Philipp Schmid, in an official company blog post on the new paradigm. \"Trying to force these capabilities into generateContent would have resulted in an overly complex and fragile API.\"\nThis shift enables Background Execution, a critical feature for the agentic era. Complex workflows—like browsing the web for an hour to synthesize a report—often trigger HTTP timeouts in standard APIs. The Interactions API allows developers to trigger an agent with background=true, disconnect, and poll for the result later. It effectively turns the API into a job queue for intelligence.\nNative \"Deep Research\" and MCP Support\nGoogle is using this new infrastructure to deliver its first built-in agent: Gemini Deep Research.\nAccessible via the same /interactions endpoint, this agent is capable of executing \"long-horizon research tasks.\" Unlike a standard model that predicts the next token based on your prompt, the Deep Research agent executes a loop of searches, reading, and synthesis.\nCrucially, Google is also embracing the open ecosystem by adding native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows Gemini models to directly call external tools hosted on remote servers—such as a weather service or a database—without the developer having to write custom glue code to parse the tool calls.\nThe Landscape: Google Joins OpenAI in the 'Stateful' Era\nGoogle is arguably playing catch-up, but with a distinct philosophical twist. OpenAI moved away from statelessness nine months ago with the launch of the Responses API in March 2025.\nWhile both giants are solving the problem of context bloat, their solutions diverge on transparency:\nOpenAI (The Compression Approach): OpenAI's Responses API introduced Compaction—a feature that shrinks conversation history by replacing tool outputs and reasoning chains with opaque \"encrypted compaction items.\" This prioritizes token efficiency but creates a \"black box\" where the model's past reasoning is hidden from the developer.\nGoogle (The Hosted Approach): Google’s Interactions API keeps the full history available and composable. The data model allows developers to \"debug, manipulate, stream and reason over interleaved messages.\" It prioritizes inspectability over compression.\nSupported Models & Availability\nThe Interactions API is currently in Public Beta (documentation here) and is available immediately via Google AI Studio. It supports the full spectrum of Google’s latest generation models, ensuring that developers can match the right model size to their specific agentic task:\n\nGemini 3.0: Gemini 3 Pro Preview.\n\nGemini 2.5: Flash, Flash-lite, and Pro.\n\nAgents: Deep Research Preview (deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025).\n\nCommercially, the API integrates into Google’s existing pricing structure—you pay standard rates for input and output tokens based on the model you select. However, the value proposition changes with the new data retention policies. Because this API is stateful, Google must store your interaction history to enable features like implicit caching and context retrieval.\nAccess to this storage is determined by your tier. Developers on the Free Tier are limited to a 1-day retention policy, suitable for ephemeral testing but insufficient for long-term agent memory. \nDevelopers on the Paid Tier unlock a 55-day retention policy. This extended retention is not just for auditing; it effectively lowers your total cost of ownership by maximizing cache hits. By keeping the history \"hot\" on the server for nearly two months, you avoid paying to re-process massive context windows for recurring users, making the Paid Tier significantly more efficient for production-grade agents.\nNote: As this is a Beta release, Google has advised that features and schemas are subject to breaking changes.\n'You Are Interacting With a System'\nSam Witteveen, a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning and CEO of Red Dragon AI, sees this release as a necessary evolution of the developer stack.\n\"If we go back in history... the whole idea was simple text-in, text-out,\" Witteveen noted in a technical breakdown of the release on YouTube. \"But now... you are interacting with a system. A system that can use multiple models, do multiple loops of calls, use tools, and do code execution on the backend.\"\n\nWitteveen highlighted the immediate economic benefit of this architecture: Implicit Caching. Because the conversation history lives on Google’s servers, developers aren't charged for re-uploading the same context repeatedly. \"You don't have to pay as much for the tokens that you are calling,\" he explained.\nHowever, the release is not without friction. Witteveen critiqued the current implementation of the Deep Research agent's citation system. While the agent provides sources, the URLs returned are often wrapped in internal Google/Vertex AI redirection links rather than raw, usable URLs.\n\"My biggest gripe is that... these URLs, if I save them and try to use them in a different session, they're not going to work,\" Witteveen warned. \"If I want to make a report for someone with citations, I want them to be able to click on the URLs from a PDF file... Having something like medium.com as a citation [without the direct link] is not very good.\"\nWhat This Means for Your Team\nFor Lead AI Engineers focused on rapid model deployment and fine-tuning, this release offers a direct architectural solution to the persistent \"timeout\" problem: Background Execution. \nInstead of building complex asynchronous handlers or managing separate job queues for long-running reasoning tasks, you can now offload this complexity directly to Google. However, this convenience introduces a strategic trade-off. \nWhile the new Deep Research agent allows for the rapid deployment of sophisticated research capabilities, it operates as a \"black box\" compared to custom-built LangChain or LangGraph flows. Engineers should prototype a \"slow thinking\" feature using the background=true parameter to evaluate if the speed of implementation outweighs the loss of fine-grained control over the research loop.\nSenior engineers managing AI orchestration and budget will find that the shift to server-side state via previous_interaction_id unlocks Implicit Caching, a major win for both cost and latency metrics. \nBy referencing history stored on Google’s servers, you automatically avoid the token costs associated with re-uploading massive context windows, directly addressing budget constraints while maintaining high performance. \nThe challenge here lies in the supply chain; incorporating Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) means your agents are connecting directly to external tools, requiring you to rigorously validate that these remote services are secure and authenticated. It is time to audit your current token spend on re-sending conversation history—if it is high, prioritizing a migration to the stateful Interactions API could capture significant savings.\nFor Senior Data Engineers, the Interactions API offers a more robust data model than raw text logs. The structured schema allows for complex histories to be debugged and reasoned over, improving overall Data Integrity across your pipelines. However, you must remain vigilant regarding Data Quality, specifically the issue raised by expert Sam Witteveen regarding citations. \nThe Deep Research agent currently returns \"wrapped\" URLs that may expire or break, rather than raw source links. If your pipelines rely on scraping or archiving these sources, you may need to build a cleaning step to extract the usable URLs. You should also test the structured output capabilities (response_format) to see if they can replace fragile regex parsing in your current ETL pipelines.\nFinally, for Directors of IT Security, moving state to Google’s centralized servers offers a paradox. It can improve security by keeping API keys and conversation history off client devices, but it introduces a new data residency risk. The critical check here is Google's Data Retention Policies: while the Free Tier retains data for only one day, the Paid Tier retains interaction history for 55 days. \nThis stands in contrast to OpenAI’s \"Zero Data Retention\" (ZDR) enterprise options. You must ensure that storing sensitive conversation history for nearly two months complies with your internal governance. If this violates your policy, you must configure calls with store=false, though doing so will disable the stateful features—and the cost benefits—that make this new API valuable.",
