    "eli12": "The article offers practical advice for engineers working with AI. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what users need and adjusting projects based on feedback. Think of it like tuning a musical instrument; small adjustments can lead to a much better performance. This matters because it helps create tools that people actually want to use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, these lessons highlight the importance of user feedback in the development process. Understanding user needs can help reduce costs and improve efficiency in product design. A practical takeaway is to integrate regular feedback loops into the development cycle to ensure the final product meets expectations.",
    "engineer": "The article discusses workflows and evaluation strategies for LLM applications, emphasizing iterative development and user-centric design. One key lesson is the need for robust evaluation metrics to assess model performance effectively. Engineers should focus on refining their models based on real-world usage data to enhance accuracy and relevance."
