  "raw_excerpt": "When Kenneth Wehr started managing the Greenlandic-language version of Wikipedia four years ago, his first act was to delete almost everything. It had to go, he thought, if it had any chance of surviving. Wehr, who’s 26, isn’t from Greenland—he grew up in Germany—but he had become obsessed with the island, an autonomous Danish territory,…",

  "speedrun": "The Greenlandic-language Wikipedia faces a dire situation as its content is being drastically reduced to ensure its survival. Kenneth Wehr, a 26-year-old manager from Germany, deleted nearly all existing articles when he took over four years ago. This drastic measure highlights the struggle of vulnerable languages in the digital age, where AI and online platforms often favor more widely spoken languages. The urgency of this issue is growing as the digital landscape continues to evolve.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This impacts speakers of Greenlandic, limiting their access to information in their native language and risking cultural erosion.",
    "On a broader scale, it reflects a trend where minority languages could be sidelined in favor of dominant languages, challenging linguistic diversity."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to keep a small garden alive in a world dominated by vast fields. That's what Kenneth Wehr is doing with Greenlandic Wikipedia. By trimming down the content, he hopes to nurture the language and culture. This matters because it shows how technology can either help or harm smaller languages and communities.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this situation highlights the need to consider user diversity in language and content. As AI tools often prioritize major languages, there’s a potential gap in meeting the needs of smaller language speakers. Companies could explore solutions that support linguistic diversity to reach underserved markets.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the challenge lies in how AI models are trained, often using datasets that favor dominant languages. This can lead to a lack of resources for languages like Greenlandic, which may not have enough data for effective AI integration. Addressing this requires developing models that can better accommodate linguistic diversity."
