  "speedrun": "A recent study by Boston Consulting Group reveals a significant gap in AI investment success. Only five percent of companies are realizing substantial value from their AI initiatives, while 60 percent are lagging behind. This disparity highlights a critical divide between AI leaders and those struggling to harness its potential. As businesses increasingly invest in AI, understanding this gap is crucial for future strategies.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies investing in AI need to recognize the challenges they face, as most are not seeing returns on their investments.",
    "The widening gap suggests a shift in the market, where only a few firms will likely dominate AI benefits, leaving others at a disadvantage."

    "eli12": "According to a study, only five out of every hundred companies are successfully using AI to make money. This means many businesses are spending on AI without seeing any real benefits. Think of it like a race where only a few runners are ahead, while most are stuck at the starting line. It's important for everyone to understand this gap, as it could affect jobs and services in the future.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this study underscores the importance of not just investing in AI but also ensuring effective implementation. The stark statistic of five percent achieving value suggests a need for better strategies and user engagement. Companies could focus on learning from the successful few to improve their own AI applications, potentially saving costs and enhancing efficiency.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the BCG study highlights a concerning trend where only five percent of firms are leveraging AI effectively, indicating potential issues in model deployment or data utilization. This suggests that many companies may not be using advanced models or best practices, leading to inefficiencies. Engineers could benefit from analyzing the success factors of the top five percent to enhance their own AI projects."
