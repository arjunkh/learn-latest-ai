  "raw_body": "Enterprises are investing billions of dollars in AI agents and infrastructure to transform business processes. However, we are seeing limited success in real-world applications, often due to the inability of agents to truly understand business data, policies and processes. \nWhile we manage the integrations well with technologies like API management, model context protocol (MCP) and others, having agents truly understand the “meaning” of data in the context of a given businesis a different story. Enterprise data is mostly siloed into disparate systems in structured and unstructured forms and needs to be analyzed with a domain-specific business lens.s\nAs an example, the term “customer” may refer to a different group of people in a Sales CRM system, compared to a finance system which may use this tag for paying clients. One department might define “product” as a SKU; another may represent as a \"product\" family; a third as a marketing bundle. \nData about “product sales” thus varies in meaning without agreed upon relationships and definitions. For agents to combine data from multiple systems, they must understand different representations. Agents need to know what the data means in context and how to find the right data for the right process. Moreover, schema changes in systems and data quality issues during collection can lead to more ambiguity and inability of agents to know how to act when such situations are encountered. \nFurthermore, classification of data into categories like PII (personally identifiable information) needs to be rigorously followed to maintain compliance with standards like GDPR and CCPA. This requires the data to be labelled correctly and agents to be able to understand and respect this classification. Hence we see that building a cool demo using agents is very much doable - but putting into production working on real business data is a different story altogether.\nThe ontology-based source of truth\nBuilding effective agentic solutions requries an ontology-based single source of truth. Ontology is a business definition of concepts, their hierarchy and relationships. It defines terms with respect to business domains, can help establish a single-source of truth for data and capture uniform field names and apply classifications to fields. \nAn ontology may be domain-specific (healthcare or finance), or organization-specific based on internal structures. Defining an ontology upfront is time consuming, but can help standardize business processes and lay a strong foundation for agentic AI. \nOntology may be realized using common queryable formats like triplestore. More complex business rules with multi-hop relations could use a labelled property graphs like Neo4j. These graphs can also help enterprises discover new relationships and answer complex questions. Ontologies like FIBO (Finance Industry Business Ontology) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) are available in the public domain and can be a very good starting point. However, these usually need to be customized to capture specific details of an enterprise.\nGetting started with ontology\nOnce implemented, an ontology can be the driving force for enterprise agents. We can now prompt AI to follow the ontology and use it to discover data and relationships. If needed, we can have an agentic layer serve key details of the ontology itself and discover data. Business rules and policies can be implemented in this ontology for agents to adhere to. This is an excellent way to ground your agents and establish guardrails based on real business context. \nAgents designed in this manner and tuned to follow an ontology can stick to guardrails and avoid hallucinations that can be caused by the large language models (LLM) powering them. For example, a business policy may define that unless all documents associated with a loan do not have verified flags set to \"true,\" the loan status should be kept in “pending” state. Agents can work around this policy and determine what documents are needed and query the knowledge base. \nHere's an example implementation:  \n(Original figure by Author)\nAs illustrated, we have structured and unstructured data processed by a document intelligence (DocIntel) agent which populates a Neo4j database based on an ontology of the business domain. A data discovery agent in Neo4j finds and queries the right data and passes it to other agents handling business process execution. The inter-agent communication happens with a popular protocol like A2A (agent to agent). A new protocol called AG-UI (Agent User Interaction) can help build more generic UI screens to capture the workings and responses from these agents. \nWith this method, we can avoid hallucinations by enforcing agents to follow ontology-driven paths and maintain data classifications and relationships. Moreover, we can scale easily by adding new assets, relationships and policies that agents can automatically comply to, and control hallucinations by defining rules for the whole system rather than individual entities. For example, if an agent hallucinates an individual 'customer,' because the connected data for the hallucinated 'customer' will not be verifiable in the data discovery, we can easily detect this anomaly and plan to eliminate it. This helps the agentic system scale with the business and manage its dynamic nature.\nIndeed, a reference architecture like this adds some overhead in data discovery and graph databases. But for a large enterprise, it adds the right guardrails and gives agents directions to orchestrate complex business processes. \nDattaraj Rao is innovation and R&D architect at Persistent Systems. \nRead more from our guest writers.

  "speedrun": "Enterprises are pouring billions into AI agents to enhance business processes, but success is limited due to agents' struggles with understanding complex data. A key issue is the varying definitions of terms like 'customer' across different departments. Implementing an ontology—a structured definition of business concepts—could help agents grasp the meaning of data in context. This approach is crucial now as businesses seek to leverage AI effectively while avoiding misunderstandings.",

    "eli12": "Think of an ontology like a dictionary for a business. It defines how different terms, like 'customer' or 'product,' are used across departments. This clarity helps AI agents understand and work with data correctly. For everyday people, this means businesses could operate more smoothly and make better decisions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, focusing on ontology means addressing user needs for clarity in data interpretation. This could enhance efficiency and reduce costs associated with data mismanagement. A practical implication is that product teams might need to invest in developing a clear ontology to support AI functionalities.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, implementing an ontology can significantly enhance AI agents' performance by providing a structured framework for data interpretation. Using models like Neo4j for graph databases allows for complex relationship mapping, which can improve data discovery. However, it’s important to consider the initial overhead in setting up such systems."
