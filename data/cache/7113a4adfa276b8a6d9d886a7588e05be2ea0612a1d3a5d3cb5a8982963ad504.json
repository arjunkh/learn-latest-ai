  "speedrun": "This year's UN climate talks in Belem, Brazil, once again sidestepped addressing fossil fuels, despite the pressing climate crisis. Attendees faced extreme heat and flooding, highlighting the urgency of climate action. The lack of focus on fossil fuels is concerning as it reflects ongoing resistance to confront the root causes of climate change. This matters now because effective climate policies could significantly impact global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate disasters.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For climate activists and vulnerable communities, the refusal to address fossil fuels could hinder progress on climate justice and adaptation strategies.",
    "At a broader level, this avoidance may indicate a shift in climate policy discussions, potentially stalling global cooperation needed for effective climate solutions."

    "eli12": "The UN climate talks in Brazil didn't talk about fossil fuels, even though they're a big part of climate change. Imagine ignoring the main source of smoke in a fire. This matters to everyone because it shows how tough it is to make real changes to protect our planet.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, the lack of focus on fossil fuels suggests a need to innovate in sustainable solutions. Users increasingly demand eco-friendly products, and ignoring this trend could lead to missed opportunities. Companies might need to rethink strategies to align with emerging climate expectations.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the UN talks' avoidance of fossil fuels reveals a gap in addressing emissions reduction strategies. Engineers and researchers could focus on developing alternative energy technologies and carbon capture methods. However, without political will, even the best technologies might struggle to gain traction."
