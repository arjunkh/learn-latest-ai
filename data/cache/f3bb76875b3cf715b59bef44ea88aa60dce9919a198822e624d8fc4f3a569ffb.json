  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.15120v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic, replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects (flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.",
