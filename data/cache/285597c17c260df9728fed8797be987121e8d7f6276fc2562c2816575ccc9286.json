  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.09114v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called AI TIPS 2.0 aims to tackle three major governance challenges in AI deployment. It highlights the need for tailored risk assessments, as seen in the Humana class action lawsuit where bias led to improper healthcare claim denials. Current frameworks like ISO 42001 provide only high-level guidance, lacking actionable controls. This update matters now as organizations seek better ways to operationalize trustworthy AI practices across their development processes.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Healthcare organizations could significantly reduce risks related to AI bias, improving patient outcomes and trust in technology.",
    "This framework could signal a shift in how companies approach AI governance, moving towards more tailored and actionable strategies."

    "eli12": "AI TIPS 2.0 is like a tailored suit for AI governance, fitting specific needs rather than using a generic template. It focuses on understanding unique risks in AI projects, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare. This matters because better governance could lead to fairer and more reliable AI systems that everyone can trust.",
    "pm": "For product managers, AI TIPS 2.0 emphasizes the importance of understanding specific user needs and risks when deploying AI. It suggests that investing in tailored governance could enhance efficiency and reduce costly errors. A practical implication is that teams might need to develop new processes to ensure compliance and measure success effectively.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, AI TIPS 2.0 addresses the shortcomings of existing frameworks like ISO 42001 by providing actionable controls tailored to specific use cases. It emphasizes the need for quantitative compliance measures and role-specific visibility throughout the development lifecycle. This approach could help engineers better integrate trustworthy AI practices into their projects."
