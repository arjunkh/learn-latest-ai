    "eli12": "Meta is changing how its chatbots talk to keep kids safe online. They will now avoid serious topics like self-harm and won't flirt with teens. Imagine if a friend stopped talking about dangerous things to keep you safe. This matters because it helps ensure that young people have healthier interactions with technology.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Meta's policy changes highlight a critical user need for safety in AI interactions. By avoiding sensitive topics, they could enhance user trust and engagement. This approach may lead to higher user retention as parents feel more comfortable with their children using these chatbots.",
    "engineer": "Meta's chatbots will be retrained to avoid sensitive discussions, focusing on algorithms that detect and filter out topics like self-harm and romantic banter. This involves adjusting the language models to recognize and respond appropriately to these triggers. The challenge will be ensuring the bots remain engaging without crossing safety boundaries."
