  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.00023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation, wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements (up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at https://toolbrain.org.",
