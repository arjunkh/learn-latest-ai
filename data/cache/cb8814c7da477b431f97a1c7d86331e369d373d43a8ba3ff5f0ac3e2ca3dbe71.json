    "eli12": "When new tech like AI comes along, people react differently. Some jump in to try it out, while others prefer to learn more first. This is like cooking: some folks dive straight into a recipe, while others read about ingredients and techniques first. Knowing these styles helps everyone work better together and adapt to new tools.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, recognizing diverse user approaches to AI can help tailor onboarding experiences. Understanding that some users may need more guidance can improve user satisfaction and retention. This could lead to creating resources that cater to both hands-on learners and those who prefer a more structured approach.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, understanding user engagement with AI tools like LLMs is essential. Developers might consider implementing features that support both exploratory and guided learning paths. This could include interactive tutorials or comprehensive documentation, addressing the varying levels of user readiness and ensuring effective tool utilization."
