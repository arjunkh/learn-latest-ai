    "eli12": "AI is now capable of doing many jobs we used to think were purely human. It can create images, write text, and even manage social media posts. Imagine a robot chef that can whip up a meal without human help. This matters because it could change what jobs look like for everyone, making some roles obsolete while creating new ones.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift means they need to consider how AI can enhance their offerings. It could lead to cost savings and improved efficiency by automating routine tasks. A practical implication is that they might need to adapt their products to leverage AI capabilities, ensuring they remain competitive.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, AI's advancements in handling diverse modalities like text, images, and audio represent significant progress in machine learning. These systems can now automate complex tasks, such as marketing campaigns, which were once labor-intensive. However, engineers should remain mindful of the ethical implications and potential biases in AI outputs."
