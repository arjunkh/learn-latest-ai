  "speedrun": "The article discusses how to use Python's Random module to introduce randomness into code outputs. It covers various functions like random(), randint(), and choice(), which help generate random numbers, select random elements, and shuffle data. This is important for applications like simulations, gaming, and testing, where unpredictability can enhance realism or robustness. Understanding these functions can significantly improve the versatility of programming projects.",

    "eli12": "The article explains how to make your computer programs less predictable by using Python's Random module. Think of it like rolling a dice; every time you roll, you get a different number. This is useful for games or simulations, making them feel more real and exciting for users.",
    "pm": "For product managers or founders, using the Random module can help meet user needs for unpredictability in apps, like gaming or testing. It could reduce development time by simplifying the implementation of random features. This means products can become more engaging and efficient without extensive custom coding.",
    "engineer": "The article details functions in Python's Random module, such as random() for floating-point numbers between 0 and 1, and randint() for generating integers within a specified range. These tools can be crucial for algorithms requiring randomness, such as Monte Carlo simulations, but developers should be aware of the limitations in randomness quality for critical applications."
