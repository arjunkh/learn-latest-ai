The learned representation is typically a neural network, making transfer of the learned environment dynamics and explainability a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach, Finite Automata Extraction (FAE), that learns a neuro-symbolic world model from gameplay video represented as programs in a novel domain-specific language (DSL): Retro Coder. Compared to prior world model approaches, FAE learns a more precise model of the environment and more general code than prior DSL-based approaches.",

  "speedrun": "The article introduces Finite Automata Extraction (FAE), a novel method for learning world models from gameplay videos using a neuro-symbolic approach. This technique utilizes a domain-specific language, Retro Coder, to create more precise and generalizable models, enhancing explainability and transferability compared to traditional neural network methods. Its significance lies in improving the efficiency and accuracy of AI systems in understanding complex environments.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "FAE's ability to generate explainable models from low-data scenarios could revolutionize AI applications in gaming and robotics, making them more adaptable and user-friendly.",
    "By leveraging a domain-specific language, FAE enhances the transferability of learned models, potentially reducing the time and resources needed for training AI in new environments."

    "eli12": "This article talks about a new way to teach computers about their surroundings using videos from games. It's cool because it helps computers understand better and explain what they learned. This means that everyday technology, like robots or video games, can become smarter and easier to use.",
    "pm": "Developers in gaming and robotics will use FAE to create smarter AI that learns from fewer examples. It solves the problem of explainability in AI models, giving businesses a competitive edge by reducing training time and costs. However, they must be cautious about the complexity of implementation and potential limitations in diverse environments.",
    "engineer": "FAE employs a neuro-symbolic framework that extracts finite automata from gameplay videos, resulting in a more structured representation of environments. The architecture uses a domain-specific language, Retro Coder, to enhance model precision and generalizability. Limitations may include the need for high-quality video data and potential challenges in scaling to more complex environments."
