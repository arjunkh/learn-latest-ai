  "speedrun": "Databricks reports a significant shift in enterprise AI adoption towards agentic systems, which enable more intelligent workflows. The initial promise of generative AI often led to underwhelming results, like isolated chatbots and unproductive pilot programs. Now, organizations are moving beyond these limitations, aiming for more integrated and effective solutions. This shift matters because it reflects a growing need for AI to deliver real operational value in businesses.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Companies looking to enhance productivity will benefit from adopting agentic systems that streamline workflows and improve efficiency.",
    "This trend indicates a broader market shift towards more effective AI solutions, moving beyond basic applications to systems that drive meaningful business outcomes."

    "eli12": "Databricks highlights a change in how businesses use AI, moving from simple chatbots to smarter systems that can handle more complex tasks. Think of it like upgrading from a basic calculator to a powerful computer that can solve bigger problems. This matters because it means AI can start making a real difference in everyday work, helping people be more productive.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift towards agentic systems suggests a growing user need for AI that integrates seamlessly into existing workflows. The focus is now on creating solutions that provide tangible benefits, rather than just novelty. This could lead to more efficient operations and a better return on investment for AI initiatives.",
    "engineer": "Technically, the move to agentic systems indicates a demand for AI models that can operate autonomously and integrate with various workflows. This contrasts with earlier generative AI implementations, which often resulted in limited functionality. Engineers will need to focus on developing systems that not only understand context but also adapt to user needs in real-time."
