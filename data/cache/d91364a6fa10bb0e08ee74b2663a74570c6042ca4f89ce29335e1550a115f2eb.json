    "eli12": "Think of AI as a helpful assistant in a busy kitchen. Just as a sous-chef can chop vegetables while the head chef focuses on the main dish, AI can handle routine tasks, letting developers concentrate on innovation. This matters to everyone because it could lead to faster, better technology that impacts daily life.",
    "pm": "For product managers, leveraging AI tools means addressing user needs more efficiently. By automating mundane tasks, teams can save time and resources, allowing for quicker iterations. This could lead to more responsive product development and a competitive edge in the market.",
    "engineer": "Technically, integrating AI into the development process can optimize workflows and reduce bottlenecks. For instance, using machine learning models to automate data analysis can improve accuracy and speed. However, developers should be mindful of the need for quality training data to ensure effective outcomes."
