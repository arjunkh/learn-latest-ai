    "eli12": "Microsoft and Apple are making computers smarter by adding AI directly to laptops instead of relying on the internet. Think of it like having a personal assistant right in your pocket instead of calling one from far away. This matters because it could make everyday tasks quicker and more efficient for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift means rethinking how products leverage AI. With more processing done locally, there could be opportunities to enhance user experience while reducing costs associated with cloud services. Planning for these changes could lead to more innovative features that directly benefit users.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, both companies are focusing on edge computing, which allows devices to process AI tasks locally. This could lead to improvements in speed and efficiency, as seen in recent benchmarks comparing cloud-based versus local processing. However, developers will need to address challenges related to hardware limitations and software optimization."
