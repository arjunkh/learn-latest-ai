  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.13002v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation, yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one driver substantially increased the likelihood of \"General Unsafe Driving\"; distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of \"Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions\"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the probability of \"Speed and Stopping Violations.\" Our framework and analytical methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention.",

    "eli12": "This study shows how AI can help understand driver behavior in crashes. By using a language model, researchers can automatically identify dangerous actions from crash reports. It's like having a smart assistant that reads and interprets traffic accident stories to find common mistakes. This matters to everyone because better insights could lead to safer roads for all drivers.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this framework highlights a growing need for automated solutions in traffic safety. By improving the accuracy of identifying hazardous actions, companies could enhance their safety features or develop new products aimed at reducing accidents. The potential for cost savings in insurance and public safety could also be significant, making this an area ripe for innovation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the study fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on two-vehicle crash narratives, achieving an 80% accuracy rate, which is higher than traditional models like Random Forest and XGBoost. The probabilistic reasoning approach allows for deeper insights into how factors like driver distraction affect crash likelihood. This suggests that integrating advanced AI techniques could lead to more effective and interpretable solutions for analyzing traffic incidents."
