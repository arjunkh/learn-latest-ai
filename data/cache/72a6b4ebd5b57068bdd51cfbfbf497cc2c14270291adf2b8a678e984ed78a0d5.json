This paper introduces \"Weight-Calculatism,\" a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.",

  "speedrun": "A new paper introduces 'Weight-Calculatism,' a cognitive architecture aimed at improving explainability and value alignment in AI. It breaks down decision-making into traceable components using a model where Weight equals Benefit times Probability. This approach could lead to more transparent AI systems that understand novel situations. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, ensuring its decisions are understandable and aligned with human values is increasingly important.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could enhance AI systems in critical fields like healthcare and finance, where understanding AI decisions is essential for trust.",
    "The introduction of Weight-Calculatism signals a move towards creating more reliable and explainable AI, potentially reshaping how AI interacts with society."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to understand a complicated recipe by breaking it down into simple steps. Weight-Calculatism does just that for AI, making its decision-making process clear and traceable. This matters because as AI takes on more responsibilities, knowing how it thinks can help us trust and work with it effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Weight-Calculatism presents an opportunity to create AI features that users can easily understand. By focusing on explainability, products can better meet user needs and build trust. This could lead to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty as users feel more in control of AI interactions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Weight-Calculatism uses a graph-algorithm-based computational engine to implement its model, which emphasizes traceability in decision processes. The architecture's ability to achieve human-like reasoning in complex scenarios is noteworthy, suggesting a significant advancement in creating aligned AGI. However, ongoing validation and testing will be crucial to ensure reliability."
