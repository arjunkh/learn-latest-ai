  "speedrun": "In the second part of the series, the article explores how HTMX can enhance a chatbot's functionality without relying on traditional JavaScript. By building on the previous example, it demonstrates adding new features that improve user interactivity. This approach simplifies development and reduces complexity for creators. As web technologies evolve, finding efficient methods like HTMX could streamline building interactive applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can create rich, interactive experiences without the overhead of JavaScript, making it easier for smaller teams to innovate.",
    "This trend reflects a broader shift towards simpler, more efficient web development tools that prioritize user experience and accessibility."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "HTMX allows developers to make web pages interactive without complex JavaScript. Imagine using a remote control to change channels instead of rewiring your TV. This means everyday users can enjoy smoother, faster web experiences without knowing the technical details.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, HTMX offers a way to meet user demands for interactivity while reducing development costs. By simplifying the tech stack, teams can deliver features faster and focus on user feedback, potentially leading to better products.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, HTMX extends HTML capabilities by allowing developers to create interactive elements with minimal JavaScript. This can lead to faster load times and reduced complexity in code. However, it’s important to consider the trade-offs in terms of browser compatibility and feature limitations."
