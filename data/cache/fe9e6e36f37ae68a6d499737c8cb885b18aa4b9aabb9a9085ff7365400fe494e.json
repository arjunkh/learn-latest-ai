  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.02480v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline ``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control (DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction, ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs. Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk for harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.",
