ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance, when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set, i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs, and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have introduced Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) to tackle model uncertainty in decision-making under partial observability. These models allow for a finite set of POMDPs that share the same spaces but differ in their transition and reward functions. A key advancement is the ability to derive robust policies that maximize worst-case rewards across all scenarios. This development is significant as it helps in situations where experts disagree on problem modeling, enhancing decision-making reliability.",

    "This approach could significantly aid industries like healthcare or finance, where expert disagreement can lead to suboptimal decisions.",
    "The introduction of ME-POMDPs indicates a shift towards more resilient AI systems that can adapt to varying expert opinions and uncertain environments."

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to navigate a maze where different guides give conflicting directions. Multi-environment POMDPs help find a path that works best, no matter which guide is right. This means everyday decisions, especially in fields like healthcare, could become more reliable, leading to better outcomes for people.",
    "pm": "For product managers, ME-POMDPs represent a way to build systems that can handle uncertainty in user needs or preferences. By developing robust policies, products could become more adaptive and efficient, potentially saving costs and improving user satisfaction. This could lead to better decision-making tools in various applications.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, ME-POMDPs generalize traditional POMDPs by incorporating discrete model uncertainty across various transition and reward functions. The research introduces algorithms for calculating robust policies, which are essential for handling adversarial-belief scenarios. This could enhance existing benchmarks in POMDPs, making them more applicable to real-world problems."
