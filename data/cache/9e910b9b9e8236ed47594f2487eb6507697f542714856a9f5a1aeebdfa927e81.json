  "speedrun": "The Alan Turing Institute has launched 'Doing AI Differently,' advocating for a human-centered approach to AI development. This initiative emphasizes the importance of integrating humanities into AI, moving beyond purely mathematical models to consider ethical, social, and cultural implications, which is crucial for responsible AI advancement.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Integrating humanities into AI development can lead to more ethical and socially responsible technologies, addressing public concerns about bias and accountability in AI systems.",
    "This initiative may reshape educational curricula and research priorities, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration that enhances innovation and societal impact in AI."

    "eli12": "A new project called 'Doing AI Differently' wants to make AI more human-friendly. It suggests that we should think about how AI affects people, not just numbers. This is cool because it can help create technology that is better for everyone.",
    "pm": "This initiative will be valuable for researchers, policymakers, and tech developers who aim to create AI that serves society. It addresses issues like bias and ethical concerns, offering a competitive edge by prioritizing user needs and societal impact. However, it also poses risks if stakeholders resist changing traditional AI development practices.",
    "engineer": "The initiative proposes a shift in AI development methodologies, advocating for a framework that incorporates human values and social sciences. This approach could improve the interpretability and usability of AI systems but may face challenges in quantifying human-centric metrics. Additionally, it requires collaboration across diverse fields, which can complicate project timelines and resource allocation."
