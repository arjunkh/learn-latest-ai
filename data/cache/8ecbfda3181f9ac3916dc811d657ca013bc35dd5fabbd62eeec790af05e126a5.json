  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.13782v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances",

  "speedrun": "Recent research highlights the limitations of advanced vision language models (VLMs) in spatial reasoning, a key aspect of human cognition. Notably, models like DeepSeek R1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle with tasks involving mental rotation and 3D geometry transformations. These models rely heavily on linguistic representations, leading to inefficiencies that increase as task complexity rises. Understanding these limitations is crucial as VLMs become more integrated into applications requiring spatial intelligence.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This research impacts developers and researchers working with VLMs, as it highlights critical areas for improvement in spatial reasoning capabilities.",

    "eli12": "This study reveals that advanced AI models struggle with understanding space, much like a person trying to navigate a new city without a map. By showing that these models rely more on language than visual cues, it highlights a gap in their abilities. Improving this could make AI more useful in everyday tasks like navigation or planning.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this research underscores the need to enhance spatial reasoning in VLMs to meet user needs in applications like AR or robotics. The inefficiencies noted suggest that investing in better spatial training methods could improve performance and user satisfaction. This could ultimately reduce costs associated with errors in spatial tasks.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the study introduces SpatiaLite, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning in VLMs. Key findings indicate that current models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, exhibit significant inefficiencies with token usage increasing as task complexity grows. The proposed Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) aims to enhance internal world modeling, which is vital for improving spatial reasoning capabilities."
