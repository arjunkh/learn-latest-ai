    "eli12": "Creating a safe space at work is like building a strong foundation for a house. Without it, everything can feel shaky and uncertain. When employees feel secure, they are more likely to share their thoughts and take risks, which can lead to better ideas and solutions. This approach matters because it can make workplaces more innovative and engaging for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding the balance between technology and culture is vital. Users need to feel comfortable using new AI tools, which means addressing their fears and uncertainties. Companies that invest in this cultural aspect could see improved user engagement and ultimately, better product adoption. This focus on psychological safety could lead to more efficient teams and innovative solutions.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, rolling out AI effectively requires not only robust models but also a supportive culture. Engineers must ensure that the technology is user-friendly and that employees are trained to use it confidently. If employees feel intimidated by the tech, even the best algorithms may not perform well. This highlights the importance of integrating user feedback into AI development to enhance both usability and acceptance."
