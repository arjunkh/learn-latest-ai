  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.25007v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\\% over a commercial CPT E/M coding system and almost 5\\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces ProFees, a large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, a crucial but burdensome task for physicians. ProFees achieved over 36% higher coding accuracy compared to a commercial system and nearly 5% better than a strong baseline. This advancement could significantly reduce the documentation burden on doctors, enhancing billing efficiency and ultimately improving patient care.",

    "eli12": "ProFees is like a smart assistant for doctors, helping them code medical services accurately and quickly. This means less paperwork and more time for patients. For everyday people, it could lead to better healthcare experiences as doctors spend more time focusing on their needs.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ProFees addresses a significant user need by streamlining E/M coding, which is often tedious for physicians. By improving efficiency and accuracy, it could reduce costs associated with billing errors, making it a valuable tool in the healthcare market.",
    "engineer": "ProFees leverages advanced LLM techniques to tackle the complexities of E/M coding. It achieved over 36% improvement in accuracy on a real-world dataset compared to existing commercial solutions. This performance highlights the potential of LLMs to handle intricate tasks in healthcare, though challenges in real-world application remain."
