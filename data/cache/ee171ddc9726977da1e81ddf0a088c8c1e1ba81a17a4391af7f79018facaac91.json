Our approach combines mixed-integer programming, constraint programming and simulated annealing in a 3-phase solution approach based on decomposition into subproblems. Next to describing our approach and describing our design decisions, we share our insights and, for the first time, lower bounds on the optimal solution values for the benchmark instances. We finally highlight open problems for which we think that addressing them could improve our approach even further.",
