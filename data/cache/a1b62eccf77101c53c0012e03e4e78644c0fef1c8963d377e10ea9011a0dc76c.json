  "speedrun": "A new approach called 'book and claim' is being introduced in air freight to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This system allows companies to fund SAF usage even if it's not available at their location. As businesses strive to meet climate goals and reduce emissions, this method could play a crucial role. It matters now because it opens up new avenues for companies to contribute to sustainability efforts in aviation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Air freight companies can now support SAF usage financially, which could accelerate their transition to greener practices.",
    "This approach signifies a shift in the aviation industry towards more sustainable practices, potentially influencing market dynamics and consumer expectations."

    "eli12": "The 'book and claim' system lets companies pay for sustainable aviation fuel even if they can't get it locally. Think of it like buying a ticket for a concert in another city—you support the event, even if you're not there. This matters because it helps businesses reduce their carbon footprint without needing immediate access to SAF.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this system addresses a growing user need for sustainability in shipping. It could lower costs associated with carbon offsets and improve efficiency in meeting climate goals. Companies might consider integrating this option into their logistics strategies to enhance their green credentials.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, 'book and claim' allows for financial transactions supporting SAF without requiring physical availability. This could lead to increased demand for SAF, potentially driving innovation in fuel production. However, the effectiveness of this model depends on regulatory frameworks and market acceptance."
