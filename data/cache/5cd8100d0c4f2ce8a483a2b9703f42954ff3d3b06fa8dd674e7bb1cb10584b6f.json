    "eli12": "Arm Holdings is stepping up in the AI world, focusing on how AI can work better at the edge, or closer to where data is created. Imagine a smart camera that can analyze footage right on-site instead of sending everything to the cloud. This matters because it could make our devices smarter and faster, impacting everyday technology like home assistants and security systems.",
    "pm": "For product managers, Arm's emphasis on edge AI highlights a user need for faster, more efficient data processing. This could reduce costs associated with cloud computing and improve user experiences. Companies might consider integrating edge computing solutions to meet rising demands for real-time data analysis.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Arm's focus on edge AI suggests a shift in processing architectures. By moving computations closer to data sources, latency could be significantly reduced compared to traditional cloud models. This transition may require new frameworks and optimizations to ensure efficiency and performance at the edge."
