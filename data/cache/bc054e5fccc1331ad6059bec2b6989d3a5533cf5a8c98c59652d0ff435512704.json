  "speedrun": "Separating logic from inference in AI agents enhances scalability by decoupling workflows from execution strategies. This shift addresses reliability issues, as large language models (LLMs) can produce inconsistent results—what works once might not work again. By creating a more stable foundation, development teams can improve performance in production-grade applications. This matters now because as AI moves from prototypes to real-world use, reliability becomes crucial for user trust and adoption.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Developers can create more dependable AI applications, which is vital for businesses relying on consistent performance.",
    "This approach signals a shift towards more structured AI development, potentially leading to broader adoption in various industries."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "When AI agents separate their thinking (logic) from how they search for answers, they become more reliable. Think of it like a chef who organizes ingredients before cooking; it makes the process smoother. This is important for everyone because it means AI can be more trustworthy in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this separation could lead to more reliable AI features, addressing user needs for consistent performance. By improving efficiency in how AI operates, it could reduce costs associated with troubleshooting and user complaints. A practical implication is that products may become more appealing to customers due to enhanced reliability.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, separating logic from inference allows for more robust AI architectures. This decoupling addresses the stochastic nature of LLMs, where prompts can yield different results. It enables teams to implement more reliable execution strategies, essential for scaling AI from prototypes to production environments."
