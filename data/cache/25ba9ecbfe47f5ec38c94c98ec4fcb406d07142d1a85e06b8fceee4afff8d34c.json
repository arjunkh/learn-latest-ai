    "eli12": "Data visualization is like turning a complex recipe into a simple infographic. Instead of reading long paragraphs of instructions, you see clear steps and images. This makes it easier for everyone to grasp important information quickly, which is essential in our data-rich world.",
    "pm": "For product managers, effective data visualization can highlight user behaviors and preferences quickly. This insight could lead to better product decisions and improved user experiences. Additionally, clear visuals can aid in communicating ideas to stakeholders, saving time and reducing misunderstandings.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, data visualization employs models like dashboards and interactive charts to represent data efficiently. Tools like D3.js or Tableau can process large datasets and display them in real-time. However, it's important to ensure that visualizations are not overly complex, as this could obscure the underlying data."
