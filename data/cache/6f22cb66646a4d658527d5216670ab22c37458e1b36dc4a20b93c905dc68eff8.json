    "eli12": "As companies use more autonomous AI agents, they might not have the right rules in place to manage them. Think of it like letting a teenager drive without a license. It’s important for everyone, as these AI systems could affect jobs and daily life if not managed properly.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this is a reminder to incorporate strong governance frameworks alongside AI development. Users need to feel safe using these technologies, and establishing clear guidelines can enhance trust. This could also reduce the risk of costly mistakes down the road.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the rapid deployment of autonomous AI agents raises questions about the frameworks used to govern them. Current models may not be equipped to handle the complexities of autonomous decision-making. Engineers should consider implementing more robust oversight mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with these AI systems."
