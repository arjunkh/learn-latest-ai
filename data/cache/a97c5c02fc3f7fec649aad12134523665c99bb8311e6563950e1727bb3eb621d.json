    "eli12": "Nucleus Genomics is encouraging parents to think about their baby's health before birth through genetic testing. It's like checking a car's engine before a long trip to avoid breakdowns. This matters because it could help families avoid passing on serious health issues to their children.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this trend highlights a growing user need for accessible genetic testing services. By addressing potential health risks early, companies can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. It suggests that investing in user-friendly genetic solutions could enhance market competitiveness.",
    "engineer": "The campaign focuses on expanded carrier screening, which tests for multiple genetic conditions simultaneously. This approach could significantly improve detection rates compared to traditional methods, which often screen for fewer disorders. However, the implications of such testing on privacy and ethical concerns remain important considerations."
