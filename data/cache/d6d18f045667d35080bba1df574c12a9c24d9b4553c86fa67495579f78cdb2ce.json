  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.04880v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval, limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving. Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.\n  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i) large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA (TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without sacrificing baseline capability.",

  "speedrun": "A new framework called Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) has been introduced to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. DMA integrates multi-granularity human feedback, allowing these systems to adapt better to changing user intent and content. In extensive tests, DMA showed significant improvements in user engagement while maintaining strong performance in conversational question-answering tasks. This advancement is crucial as it could lead to more responsive and effective AI interactions in real-time applications.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "DMA could directly improve user experiences in applications that rely on real-time AI interactions, such as chatbots or virtual assistants.",
    "This development signals a broader shift towards more adaptive AI systems that can learn and evolve based on user feedback, enhancing overall AI effectiveness."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) is like giving a chatbot a better memory to remember what users want. By using feedback from users, it helps the AI adjust its responses in real-time. This could make conversations with AI feel more natural and tailored to individual needs, which is important for everyday users seeking helpful interactions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, DMA represents a way to make AI tools more responsive to user needs. By integrating real-time feedback, it could enhance user satisfaction and engagement. This means that investing in such adaptive systems could lead to better retention and a more efficient use of resources in developing AI products.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, DMA employs supervised training and policy optimization to process human feedback at various levels. It uses a dual-track evaluation, combining online A/B testing and offline benchmarks, achieving competitive results in conversational QA tasks like TriviaQA. This approach allows for real-time learning without compromising the foundational capabilities of RAG systems."
