  "raw_body": "arXiv:2512.11835v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as powerful yet opaque systems, leaving open how their internal memory and \"self-like\" behavior should be governed in a principled and auditable way. The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.",

  "speedrun": "Researchers have proposed a new framework for governing the internal behavior of large language models (LLMs) using a concept called the Artificial Age Score (AAS). This framework organizes 20 monads from Leibniz's Monadology into six bundles, which help impose structured constraints on LLM memory and behavior. Their experiments demonstrated that this system leads to more interpretable and controlled actions of LLMs. This matters now as it offers a pathway to make AI systems more transparent and accountable.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to understand a complex machine without any labels or instructions. The new framework for LLMs acts like a user manual, providing clear guidelines on how these systems remember and behave. By making AI more understandable, it helps everyday users trust and engage with technology more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this framework highlights a growing user demand for transparency in AI systems. By implementing the AAS structure, they could enhance user trust and satisfaction while potentially reducing costs associated with managing AI behavior. This could lead to more efficient product development cycles.",
    "engineer": "The proposed clause architecture uses the AAS as a foundation to create structured constraints on LLM behavior. The framework's six bundles allow for numerical experiments that reveal how LLMs can maintain continuous performance while penalizing contradictions. This approach could improve the interpretability and reliability of AI systems in practical applications."
