    "eli12": "Datatonic highlights that many businesses are struggling because they aren't using AI properly alongside their workers. Think of it like a team where one player doesn't know the game rules—everyone suffers. This matters because if companies don’t fix this, they could lose jobs and their competitive edge.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this insight suggests a need to prioritize effective human-AI collaboration in product design. Understanding user needs and ensuring AI complements human roles could improve efficiency and reduce costs. This focus might also help in retaining talent and fostering innovation.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Datatonic's findings point to the importance of designing AI systems that work seamlessly with human input. The concept of 'human-in-the-loop' is essential, as it can enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. However, the challenge lies in ensuring these systems are well-governed to prevent misalignment."
