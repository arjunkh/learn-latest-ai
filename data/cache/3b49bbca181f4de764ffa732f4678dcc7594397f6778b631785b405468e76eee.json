    "eli12": "Think of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process like a weather app that learns from past temperatures to predict future ones. It helps scientists understand how temperatures might change over time, which is important for everyone. Better predictions mean we can prepare for heatwaves or cold snaps more effectively.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, understanding temperature modeling can inform climate-related products or services. By leveraging accurate predictions, they could better address user needs around climate resilience. This approach might also lead to cost efficiencies in developing solutions that anticipate environmental changes.",
    "engineer": "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a stochastic differential equation that models mean-reverting behavior, making it suitable for temperature data analysis. This method allows for capturing the randomness in temperature fluctuations while estimating long-term trends. Engineers should consider how this model could enhance data-driven climate solutions, although it may require substantial computational resources."
