    "eli12": "Manufacturers are facing tough challenges like high costs and fewer workers. They are using AI to help solve these problems, much like a coach uses data to improve a team's performance. This is important for everyone because it could lead to better products and services at lower prices.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this trend signals a need to integrate AI into manufacturing processes to meet customer demands efficiently. By reducing costs and improving quality, companies could enhance user satisfaction while maintaining competitiveness. This could lead to innovative product offerings that better align with market needs.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, manufacturers are deploying AI models to predict equipment failures and optimize production lines. This application of AI not only reduces downtime but also enhances overall throughput and quality. However, the effectiveness of these models depends on the quality of data and integration with existing systems."
