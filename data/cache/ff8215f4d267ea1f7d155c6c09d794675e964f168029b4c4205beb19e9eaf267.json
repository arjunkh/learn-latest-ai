    "eli12": "Waymo's new robotaxi service runs without a driver, similar to how a smart assistant can manage tasks without human help. This could make getting around cities easier and less stressful for everyone. As more people use these services, it could change how we think about transportation in our daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Waymo's expansion highlights a growing user demand for autonomous solutions. This could lead to reduced operational costs and increased efficiency in urban transport. Companies should consider how to integrate or compete with such technologies to meet evolving consumer needs.",
    "engineer": "Waymo's robotaxi utilizes advanced algorithms and machine learning models to navigate complex urban environments autonomously. With this rollout, they are testing the limits of their technology in real-world conditions. Engineers should note the implications for safety and reliability benchmarks as these vehicles operate without human intervention."
