  "raw_body": "arXiv:2511.00020v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the current digital commerce landscape, user-generated reviews play a critical role in shaping consumer behavior, product reputation, and platform credibility. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often generated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to trust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models primarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to capture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this gap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed, integrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted using ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head to jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated dataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery, hospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate that the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative analysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such as exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images, commonly found in deceptive content. This study demonstrates the critical role of multimodal learning in safeguarding digital trust and offers a scalable solution for content moderation across various online platforms.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to judge a book by its cover while also reading the first few pages. This study combines both visuals and text to identify fake reviews, making it easier for consumers to trust what they see online. As fake reviews become more common, this tool could help everyday people make better purchasing decisions.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this model highlights the importance of integrating multiple data types to enhance user trust. By improving the detection of fake reviews, businesses could reduce the risk of reputational damage and increase customer satisfaction. Implementing such technology could lead to more efficient content moderation processes.",
    "engineer": "This research leverages BERT for textual analysis and ResNet-50 for visual feature extraction, creating a robust multimodal detection system. The model's F1-score of 0.934 indicates strong performance against traditional unimodal methods, particularly in identifying subtle inconsistencies in review content. This approach could set a new benchmark for fake review detection in various online platforms."
