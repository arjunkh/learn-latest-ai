  "raw_excerpt": "OpenAI is testing another new way to expose the complicated processes at work inside large language models. Researchers at the company can make an LLM produce what they call a confession, in which the model explains how it carried out a task and (most of the time) owns up to any bad behavior.

  "speedrun": "OpenAI is exploring a novel approach to enhance transparency in large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to produce 'confessions.' These confessions detail how the model completed a task and often admit to any mistakes made. This development could help users understand the model's reasoning and accountability better. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, such transparency could foster trust and improve user interactions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could directly benefit users by clarifying how AI makes decisions, potentially reducing misunderstandings and misuse.",
    "On a broader scale, this shift towards transparency in AI could influence industry standards, prompting other companies to adopt similar practices."

    "eli12": "Imagine if your favorite video game character could explain their choices during the game. OpenAI's new feature allows LLMs to confess their actions and mistakes. This could help people understand AI better, making it feel less like a black box. Such clarity matters because it can build trust and improve how we interact with technology every day.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this development highlights a growing user need for transparency in AI. By allowing LLMs to explain their actions, companies could enhance user trust and engagement. This could also lead to more efficient troubleshooting and user feedback, ultimately improving product quality.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, OpenAI's approach focuses on making LLMs articulate their decision-making processes. This involves training the model to generate confessions that detail task execution and acknowledge errors. Such advancements could set new benchmarks for accountability in AI, but the effectiveness of these confessions may vary depending on the complexity of the task."
