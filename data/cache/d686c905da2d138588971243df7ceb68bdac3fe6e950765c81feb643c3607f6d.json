We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book \"Life and Death Dictionary\" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.",

  "speedrun": "A recent study explored how advanced Go solvers tackle Life-and-Death (L&D) problems using Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) techniques. The researchers analyzed seven L&D problems from a respected Go book and found that solvers identified crucial relevance-zones and discovered some rare patterns. Interestingly, two problems led to different solutions than those provided by human experts. This research highlights the evolving capabilities of AI in understanding complex strategic games like Go.",

    "eli12": "This study looks at how AI solves tricky problems in the game of Go. It’s like teaching a robot to find the best moves by focusing on the most important parts of the board. These findings could help players understand new strategies and enhance their gameplay, making Go even more exciting for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this research highlights the importance of focusing on critical areas when solving complex problems. By utilizing relevance-zones, teams could potentially enhance their decision-making processes, leading to more effective solutions. Understanding AI's approach could inspire innovative features in strategic games or problem-solving applications.",
    "engineer": "The study employed Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) to analyze Life-and-Death problems, revealing that solvers identified critical areas and discovered rare patterns. However, two issues were noted: misjudgment of rare patterns and a tendency to prioritize survival over territory maximization. These insights could inform future improvements in Go solvers and highlight areas where current models diverge from human strategies."
