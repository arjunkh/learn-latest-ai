  "raw_body": "arXiv:2509.07011v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed in this study.",

  "speedrun": "A new study introduces a method for selecting renewable energy sources using a model that combines fuzzy logic and multi-criteria decision-making. This approach applies Fermatean fuzzy sets to address uncertainties in decision-making, particularly in the context of energy needs and climate change. The method focuses on maximizing deviations to optimize feature weights, which could help balance carbon emissions and energy demands. This is crucial now as the world seeks effective strategies for sustainable energy solutions.",

    "eli12": "This study explores how we can better choose renewable energy sources using a smart decision-making method. Think of it like picking the best fruits from a mixed basket based on their ripeness and taste. By using fuzzy logic, it helps decision-makers weigh different factors more clearly. This matters because better energy choices can lead to a healthier planet for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders in the energy sector, this research highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in selecting renewable sources. Understanding user needs around sustainability could lead to more efficient solutions and lower costs. Practically, adopting such models could enhance product offerings that align with environmental goals, appealing to eco-conscious consumers.",
    "engineer": "The study leverages Fermatean fuzzy sets within a multi-criteria decision-making framework, focusing on deviation maximization to optimize weights for partially known features. This approach effectively manages uncertainties in energy source selection, which is critical given the complex interplay of factors like carbon emissions and energy demands. Engineers could consider this model for developing more robust energy systems."
