  "speedrun": "Consensus has integrated GPT-5 and OpenAI’s Responses API into a multi-agent research assistant, enabling it to read and synthesize research in minutes. This tool is already aiding over 8 million researchers in speeding up scientific discovery. By automating the analysis of evidence, it could significantly reduce the time spent on literature reviews. This development matters now as researchers face an increasing volume of data and need efficient ways to navigate it.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Researchers can save time and focus on critical analysis rather than sifting through data, enhancing productivity.",
    "This reflects a broader trend in academia where AI tools are increasingly used to streamline research processes and manage growing information demands."

    "eli12": "Consensus is like having a super-smart assistant that can quickly read and summarize research papers for you. With GPT-5, it helps over 8 million researchers find what they need faster. This matters because it makes scientific discovery more efficient, allowing researchers to focus on innovative ideas instead of getting lost in data.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this tool addresses the growing user need for efficiency in research. By integrating AI, it could lower costs related to time and manpower in data analysis. A practical implication is that teams can now allocate resources to more strategic tasks rather than manual data review.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Consensus leverages GPT-5's advanced language processing capabilities through the Responses API. This allows the assistant to quickly analyze large volumes of research data, synthesizing findings efficiently. While the integration shows strong promise, ongoing evaluation of accuracy and reliability in various research fields will be essential."
