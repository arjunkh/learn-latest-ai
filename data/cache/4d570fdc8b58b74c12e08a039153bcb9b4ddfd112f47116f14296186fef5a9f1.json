  "raw_body": "Presented by Salesforce \n\nVibe coding — the fast-growing trend of using generative AI to spin up code from plain-language prompts — is quick, creative, and great for instant prototypes. But many argue that it's not cut out for building production-ready business apps with the security, governance, and trusted infrastructure that enterprises require. In other words, a few saved hours in development can mean a future full of security vulnerabilities, endless maintenance, and scalability headaches, says Mohith Shrivastava, principal developer advocate at Salesforce.\n\"For rapid experimentation, building minimum viable products, and tackling creative challenges, vibe coding is a game-changer,\" Shrivastava says. \"However, that same speed and improvisational nature are exactly what makes its application in a professional, enterprise setting a topic of intense debate. And the skepticism from the developer community is 100% justified.\"\nRisks and rewards of vibe coding \nThe excitement is all about speed: going from a rough idea to a working prototype in hours, not weeks, is a massive advantage. But as Shrivastava shared, developers have been vocal about the potential downsides.\n\"When you apply vibe coding indiscriminately to an entire application stack, you’re not just moving fast; you’re accumulating risk at an unprecedented rate,\" Shrivastava explains. \"The cons are significant.\" \nThat includes potential security nightmares, as AI models don't typically take into consideration the company's specific security policies. They can easily introduce vulnerabilities like hardcoded secrets or use insecure, hallucinated packages. Then there’s the issue of what Shrivastava calls \"spaghetti code on steroids,\" or verbose code that lacks a coherent architectural pattern, creating a mountain of technical debt.\nEqually concerning is the illusion of progress: vibe coding may complete 80% of a feature in record time, but the remaining 20% — the edge cases, performance tuning, and compliance work — becomes exponentially harder.\nBut does this mean vibe coding has no place in the enterprise?\n\"The idea that you can just vibe your way to a complex, secure, and maintainable enterprise application is a dangerous fantasy,\" Shrivastava says. \"But — the pros are undeniable if it's used correctly. The key is not to avoid vibe coding, but to apply it intelligently in your enterprise.\"\nRed and green zones: Enterprise-grade vibe coding\nYou can't, and you absolutely should not, vibe code your entire enterprise stack with just any generic tool, Shrivastava warns. But when paired with no-, low-, or pro-code tools that are built for the enterprise, many of the gaps can be addressed. An enterprise-grade vibe coding solution, for example, can automatically scan for security issues, flag performance bottlenecks, and provide a safety net. \nIt’s also critical to understand which parts of an application suit this approach — and which demand a higher level of trust and control. Shrivastava divides the stack into red and green zones to illustrate.\nThe green zone is the presentation layer, or the UI and UX. It’s ideal for vibe coding, where developers can move fast and iterate quickly without much risk. In contrast is the red zone, which covers the foundational pillars of an application, including business logic and data layers.\nEmpowering developers in the green zone\nDeveloper expertise remains the foundation for effective and safe vibe coding. But developers can be amplified by AI tools and emerging agents that are grounded in business context, connected to real applications, integrations, and data flows.\n\"A generic AI agent can't grasp your company's unique processes, but a context-aware tool can act as a powerful pair programmer, helping a developer draft complex logic or model data with greater speed and accuracy,\" Shrivastava says. \"It’s about making the expert developer more efficient, not trying to do their job for them.\"\nSome areas will always be high risk for ungoverned AI — especially infrastructure and security. Letting a generic AI agent configure firewalls or Identity and Access Management [IAM] policies without oversight, Shrivastava warns, is a recipe for disaster. The solution isn’t to avoid the red zone entirely, but to approach it with the right tools — ones that embed governance, security, and context from the ground up.\n\"The winning strategy is clear: Vibe code the green zone for agility, approach the red zone by augmenting your developers with powerful, context-aware tools, and never, ever DIY your core infrastructure with AI,\" he says.\nEmbracing enterprise vibe coding\nTo harness the power of enterprise vibe coding, Salesforce developed Agentforce Vibes. This new vibe coding offering for the enterprise includes Agentforce, an autonomous AI agent built to collaborate like a pair programmer on the Salesforce Platform. It’s designed precisely to provide developers with the right tools for the job, covering both the green and red zones. For the green zone, it offers the speed and agility to rapidly build UIs and prototypes. But its true power lies in how it augments developers in the red zone.\n\"Enterprise vibe coding like Agentforce lets organizations take AI-assisted development to the organizational level, accelerating coding, testing, and deployment, while ensuring consistency, security, and performance,\" says Dan Fernandez, VP of product, developer services at Salesforce. \"It's not about throwing away governance for speed; it’s about integrating AI into every stage of the application lifecycle to work smarter.\"\nBecause Agentforce Vibes’ tooling is deeply integrated with your business context on the platform, it can safely assist with business logic and data modeling. Most importantly, it operates on a trusted platform. Instead of a DIY approach — jury-rigging a generic AI agent to handle your networking — developers build on a foundation that has security and governance built in, so they can innovate safely, knowing the most critical layers of the stack are secure and compliant.\nMajor enterprises are putting vibe coding to work \nAgentforce Vibes users are now tapping the tool to build around 20 to 25% of their new code base, according to Salesforce data, and users are accepting around 1.2 million lines of agentic code per month. That includes companies like Coinbase, CGI, Grupo Globo, and one of the top five banks in the U.S., which is using Agentforce Vibes capabilities to develop production-ready apps faster. \nAgentforce Vibes is part of a suite of tools in Agentforce 360 that span from no-code and low-code to pro-code development. These tools are together helping customers develop and deploy at speeds previously unheard of.\nWith the low-code Agent Builder in Agentforce, the Secret Escapes team was able to build, test, and launch their agent to support customer service in just two weeks, compared to the six months it had previously taken the company to build and train a bot. \nWith Agentforce, 1-800Accountant autonomously resolved 70% of customer chat engagements during tax week in 2025, without writing a line of code, using Salesforce’s low-code tools and AI assistance. Meanwhile, media company Grupo Globo deployed agents to identify subscribers at risk of lapsing, offer personalized upgrades, cross-sell, and convert non-subscribers. As a result, Agentforce boosted Globo’s retention rates by 22% in less than three months.\nInnovation meets discipline \nEnterprise tools show that disciplined engineering and creative experimentation can coexist — and that balance, Shrivastava says, is the key to lasting innovation.\n\"Vibe coding is not a fad, but it's also not a silver bullet that will replace disciplined software engineering,\" Shrivastava says. \"The smart path forward is a hybrid approach where human software skills are augmented with agentic intelligence. This balanced approach is how you get the best of both worlds: radical innovation at the edge and unwavering stability at the core.\"\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.
