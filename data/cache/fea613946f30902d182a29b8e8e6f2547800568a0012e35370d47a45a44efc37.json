  "raw_body": "arXiv:2510.17940v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders; the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.",

  "speedrun": "A new study highlights the importance of retrieval diversity in improving multi-turn intent understanding for task-oriented chatbots. By focusing on selecting diverse exemplars instead of just longer prompts, researchers achieved better performance in Joint Goal Accuracy on datasets like MultiWOZ 2.4. This method balances intent coverage and linguistic variety while respecting token budgets. The findings are significant as they offer a practical approach to enhancing chatbot effectiveness in real-world applications.",

    "eli12": "This study shows that using a variety of examples can help chatbots understand user intents better. Instead of just feeding them longer sentences, mixing in different types of responses works well. Think of it like adding different flavors to a dish to make it more enjoyable. This matters because it could lead to chatbots that are more helpful and effective in everyday tasks.",
    "pm": "For product managers, this approach highlights the need to balance relevance and diversity in chatbot design. By focusing on varied examples, teams could enhance user satisfaction while managing costs effectively. This could lead to more efficient deployments that meet user needs without exceeding budget constraints.",
    "engineer": "The study introduces a diversity-aware retrieval framework that improves intent understanding in large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates significant gains in Joint Goal Accuracy on benchmarks like MultiWOZ 2.4, outperforming existing LLM and dialogue state tracking baselines. Key specifics include sensitivity analyses over exemplar count and diversity strength, suggesting that a thoughtful selection of diverse examples can enhance performance within fixed token budgets."
