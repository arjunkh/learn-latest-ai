Companies in the U.S. can now install drone docking stations on their properties, provided they have FAA waivers. This shift could change how businesses approach theft prevention, making it more proactive and tech-driven. As shoplifting continues to challenge retailers, this innovation could provide a new layer of security.",

    "eli12": "Flock Safety is now letting businesses use drones to fight shoplifting, which is a big change from only working with police. Think of it like having a security guard in the sky, watching over stores. This matters because it could help local shops feel safer and more secure against theft.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Flock's shift to private-sector drones highlights a growing user need for innovative security solutions. By reducing theft, businesses could see improved profit margins. This also suggests a potential partnership opportunity with security firms to enhance their service offerings.",
    "engineer": "Flock Safety's drones will be equipped for real-time surveillance, leveraging existing FAA regulations for private use. Companies can now deploy docking stations to automate drone operations, which could lead to faster response times during theft incidents. However, the effectiveness will depend on the quality of the drone's sensors and the integration with existing security systems."
