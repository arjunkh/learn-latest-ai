    "eli12": "Imagine trying to bake a cake without a recipe. You might end up with a mess instead of a treat. Similarly, AI coding agents need clear instructions to produce good code. By optimizing how we communicate with these tools, everyday developers can save time and reduce frustration.",
    "pm": "For product managers, improving AI coding agents means addressing user needs for efficiency and accuracy. By focusing on context and clear parameters, teams could reduce costs associated with debugging and rework. This approach could lead to better user satisfaction and a more effective product.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, optimizing the context for AI coding agents involves refining input parameters and task definitions. Studies show that agents perform better with structured queries, potentially increasing output quality by up to 30%. However, the effectiveness can vary based on the complexity of the tasks and the AI model used."
