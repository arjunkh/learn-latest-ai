  "speedrun": "MIT has introduced a method that allows large language models (LLMs) to adjust their computational power based on task difficulty. This innovation not only lowers energy consumption but also enables smaller models to handle more complex tasks effectively. By optimizing how LLMs operate, this approach could lead to more sustainable AI applications. As energy efficiency becomes increasingly important, this development is particularly relevant now.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "This could significantly lower operational costs for companies relying on AI, as smaller models become viable for complex tasks.",
    "The shift towards energy-efficient models reflects a broader trend in AI development, prioritizing sustainability alongside performance."

    "eli12": "MIT's new method helps AI models use just the right amount of computing power based on how tough a task is. Imagine a car that adjusts its speed based on the road conditions, saving fuel and effort. This matters because it could make AI tools more accessible and environmentally friendly for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this method suggests a way to enhance user experience while cutting costs. Smaller, efficient models could meet user needs without the heavy computational burden. This could lead to faster development cycles and lower infrastructure expenses.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the new method allows LLMs to dynamically scale their computation, which can lead to significant energy savings. This adaptability could enable models to perform complex tasks without requiring extensive resources, making it easier to deploy AI in various applications."
