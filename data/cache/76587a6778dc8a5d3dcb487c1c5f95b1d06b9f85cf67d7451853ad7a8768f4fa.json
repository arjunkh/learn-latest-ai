  "speedrun": "A new approach to chatbots is being developed that allows them to respond not just with text, but also with images and tables drawn from source documents. This multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the ability of chatbots to provide richer and more informative answers. Currently, many chatbots struggle to include figures from their sources, limiting their usefulness. This advancement could significantly improve user experience and information accuracy in AI interactions.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Users seeking detailed information will benefit from more comprehensive responses that include visual data and figures, enhancing understanding.",
    "This shift towards multimodal responses could signal a broader trend in AI development, emphasizing the importance of rich content in automated systems."

    "eli12": "Imagine asking a chatbot a question and getting not just a text answer, but also images and charts that explain the topic better. This new method makes chatbots more helpful and informative. It matters because it could help people understand complex information more easily in their daily lives.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this multimodal RAG approach could meet user needs for richer content in responses. By integrating visuals and data, chatbots could become more efficient in delivering information, potentially increasing user engagement and satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, this multimodal RAG model enhances chatbots by incorporating data from various formats, including text, images, and tables. This could improve the accuracy of responses, as chatbots become capable of referencing specific figures from source documents, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the queried topic."
