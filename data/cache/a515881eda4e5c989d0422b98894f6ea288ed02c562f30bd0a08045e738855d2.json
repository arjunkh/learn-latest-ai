    "eli12": "Human-centered data analytics means focusing on how data impacts real people instead of just numbers. Imagine a restaurant that asks customers what they enjoy rather than just counting how many meals they sell. This approach helps businesses connect better with their audience and improve overall satisfaction.",
    "pm": "For product managers, prioritizing human-centered analytics can enhance user satisfaction and loyalty. By understanding user needs and motivations, teams can create products that resonate more deeply. This approach might lead to lower churn rates and increased customer engagement.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, human-centered data analytics often involves using models that incorporate user feedback and behavior patterns. Techniques like sentiment analysis can provide insights that traditional metrics miss. However, relying solely on quantitative data without considering qualitative aspects can lead to incomplete conclusions."
