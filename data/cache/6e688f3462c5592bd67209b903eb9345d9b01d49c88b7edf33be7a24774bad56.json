    "eli12": "Shapley Values help explain how different factors influence AI decisions, but they can sometimes mislead us. Think of it like trying to understand a recipe by only looking at one ingredient. Knowing their limitations matters because it helps us better understand and trust the technology behind everyday tools we use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding the limitations of Shapley Values is essential for developing user-friendly AI features. It could lead to more effective communication about model decisions, enhancing user trust. This awareness can also inform product iterations, ensuring that AI outputs are both accurate and understandable.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Shapley Values can fail in certain scenarios, particularly when dealing with correlated features or high-dimensional data. This can lead to incorrect attributions of importance to features. Engineers should consider alternative explainability methods to ensure robust insights and maintain model reliability."
