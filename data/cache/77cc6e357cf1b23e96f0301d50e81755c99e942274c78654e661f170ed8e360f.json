    "eli12": "Context engineering is like giving a GPS more details about your destination. It helps the system understand what you really want, leading to better answers. This matters because when AI can grasp context, it makes interactions smoother and more helpful for everyone.",
    "pm": "For product managers, context engineering addresses the user need for accurate information. By enhancing question answering systems, it could reduce miscommunication and improve efficiency. This means users are more likely to find what they need quickly, enhancing overall product value.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, context engineering involves adjusting the input parameters of AI models to better capture user intent. This could include fine-tuning models to recognize contextual cues, which may lead to improved accuracy in responses. However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality of the training data and the specific algorithms used."
