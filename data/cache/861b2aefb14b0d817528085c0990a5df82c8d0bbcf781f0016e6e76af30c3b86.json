    "eli12": "The article reveals that popular Python libraries might not perform Fourier transforms as expected. It’s like using a recipe that seems familiar but doesn’t taste right. By following the guide, users can ensure their results are accurate, which is crucial for tasks like audio processing or image analysis.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, ensuring accurate data processing is essential for user satisfaction and product reliability. If FFT functions yield unexpected results, it could impact user trust and product performance. This guide offers a way to enhance reliability, potentially reducing costs associated with debugging and user complaints.",
    "engineer": "The article focuses on the numerical implementation of the Fourier Transform in Python, specifically addressing the functionality of FFT in NumPy and SciPy. It suggests that users might not fully grasp the underlying computations, which can lead to inaccuracies. By implementing the Fourier Transform step-by-step, engineers can achieve more precise results, which is crucial in fields like signal processing."
