    "eli12": "Claude, an AI, can now stop conversations that are inappropriate all by itself. This is cool because it helps keep people safe when they talk to AI. It means that regular users can feel more comfortable and secure when using technology.",
    "pm": "Businesses that use Claude will benefit from this feature, especially in customer service and mental health sectors. It addresses the problem of harmful interactions, giving companies a competitive edge in user trust and safety. However, there are risks if the AI misinterprets conversations.",
    "engineer": "The new feature likely employs natural language processing algorithms to detect inappropriate content in real-time. It may use a combination of predefined rules and machine learning models to assess context. Limitations include potential false positives, where appropriate discussions are incorrectly flagged, impacting user experience."
