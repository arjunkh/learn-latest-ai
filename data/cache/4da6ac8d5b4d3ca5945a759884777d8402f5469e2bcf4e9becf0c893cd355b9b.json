    "eli12": "IBM's new AI model, Granite 4.0 Nano, is like a mini-computer that can think for itself right where you are, rather than sending data to a faraway server. This is important because it allows devices to work faster and keep your information safer. Everyday people could benefit from quicker responses in apps and smarter devices without needing constant internet access.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Granite 4.0 Nano presents an opportunity to create applications that are faster and more efficient. By leveraging on-device processing, products could reduce operational costs and improve user experience. This could lead to innovative features that operate seamlessly without relying heavily on cloud services.",
    "engineer": "Granite 4.0 Nano is engineered for edge computing, emphasizing on-device processing with potentially lower power consumption and faster response times. While specific benchmarks were not detailed, the model's small size suggests a focus on optimizing performance for real-time applications. Engineers should consider its integration into IoT devices and other localized systems to enhance functionality."
