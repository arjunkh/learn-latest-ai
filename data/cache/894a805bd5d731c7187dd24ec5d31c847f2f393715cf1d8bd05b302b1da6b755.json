    "eli12": "Tesla and Intel might team up to create AI chips that are much cheaper than Nvidia’s. Imagine being able to buy a luxury car for the price of a bicycle; that’s the kind of savings we’re talking about. This is important because it could make powerful AI tools available to more people and businesses, not just those who can afford Nvidia’s high prices.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this partnership could mean a significant reduction in costs for AI infrastructure. Cheaper chips could lead to more efficient product development and allow startups to compete with larger companies. This shift might enable a new wave of innovation in AI applications.",
    "engineer": "From a technical standpoint, the partnership could leverage Intel's manufacturing capabilities to produce chips that are more cost-effective than Nvidia's offerings. If they achieve this 10% cost target, it could disrupt existing benchmarks for performance and pricing in AI hardware. However, the actual performance metrics and capabilities of these new chips remain to be seen."
