    "eli12": "Imagine telling a robot to make a chair just by describing it. MIT's new system does just that, turning words into real objects using AI. This could change how we think about making things, making it easier for anyone to create their ideas. It matters because it could open up new possibilities for creativity and innovation in everyday life.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this technology could reshape product development. By enabling quick prototyping from text, it addresses user needs for speed and customization. This could lower costs associated with traditional manufacturing, allowing companies to test ideas more efficiently and respond to market demands faster.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the system integrates generative AI with robotics to interpret natural language prompts and produce physical objects. This approach could involve using advanced models like GPT for language understanding and robotic arms for fabrication. While promising, challenges remain in ensuring precision and scalability in production."
