  "speedrun": "Despite the widespread impact of the common cold, there is still no vaccine available. Researchers face challenges due to the virus's many strains and how it evolves rapidly. For instance, rhinoviruses, which cause most colds, have over 160 different types. This complexity makes it difficult to create a one-size-fits-all vaccine. Understanding these challenges is crucial, especially as cold season approaches.",

    "People, especially children, face increased illness during cold season, highlighting the need for effective prevention methods.",

    "eli12": "Imagine trying to catch a slippery fish with a net that has holes. That’s what scientists face when trying to create a cold vaccine. With so many different cold viruses, a single vaccine might not work for everyone. This matters to us because it means colds will continue to spread, especially in crowded places like schools.",
    "pm": "For product managers, the difficulty in developing a cold vaccine highlights a significant user need for effective cold prevention solutions. This ongoing challenge could lead to opportunities for innovative products, such as supplements or other health tools. Understanding the complexities involved can help shape future offerings in the health market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the common cold is primarily caused by rhinoviruses, which have over 160 distinct types. Their rapid mutation and genetic diversity complicate vaccine development, as a single vaccine may not target all strains effectively. These challenges underscore the importance of ongoing research in virology and immunology."
