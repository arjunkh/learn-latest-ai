  "raw_excerpt": "For decades, business continuity planning meant preparing for anomalous events like hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or regional power outages. In anticipation of these rare disasters, IT teams built playbooks, ran annual tests, crossed their fingers, and hoped they’d never have to use them.

  "speedrun": "VMware is shifting how businesses approach continuity planning, moving from traditional disaster scenarios to addressing the increasing threat of cyber incidents. As cyberattacks become more common, companies must adapt their strategies to ensure ongoing operations. This change is crucial now, as over 70% of organizations have reported experiencing a cyberattack in the past year, highlighting the urgent need for robust planning.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Businesses face immediate risks from cyber threats, requiring updated continuity plans to protect data and operations effectively.",
    "This shift indicates a broader trend where cybersecurity becomes a central focus in business strategy, reflecting the changing landscape of risks."

    "eli12": "Business continuity used to focus on natural disasters, but now it's crucial to prepare for cyberattacks. Think of it like upgrading your home security system because break-ins are becoming more common. This shift matters for everyone because it helps protect not just businesses but also personal data and services we rely on daily.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this shift emphasizes the need for solutions that address cyber threats in continuity planning. Users are increasingly concerned about data security, which could drive demand for products that integrate robust cyber resilience features. Ensuring your offerings align with this need could enhance user trust and market competitiveness.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, VMware's approach requires integrating advanced cybersecurity measures into existing continuity frameworks. This could involve implementing real-time monitoring systems and automated response protocols to mitigate risks. As cyber incidents rise, engineers must focus on building resilient architectures that can withstand these persistent threats."
