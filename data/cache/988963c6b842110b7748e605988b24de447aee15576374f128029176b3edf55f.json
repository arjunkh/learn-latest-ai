    "eli12": "Extracting metadata from documents is like finding the main ingredients in a recipe. Knowing who wrote it, when, and what itâ€™s about helps you understand the document better. This matters for everyone because it makes accessing important information faster and easier.",
    "pm": "For product managers, understanding how to extract metadata can enhance user experience by providing quick access to relevant information. This could reduce costs related to manual data processing and improve efficiency. A practical implication is that incorporating these techniques into products could lead to higher user satisfaction.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, extracting metadata involves using algorithms and tools designed for document parsing. Techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help identify key elements like authors and dates. However, challenges may arise with complex formats or inconsistent data, which require robust solutions."
