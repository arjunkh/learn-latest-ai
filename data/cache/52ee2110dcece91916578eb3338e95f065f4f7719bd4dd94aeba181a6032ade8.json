  "speedrun": "Joanna Wakefield-Scurr, a biomechanics professor, has dedicated 20 years to researching breast support, driven by her own experiences with pain. Her efforts have led to the formation of an 18-person team focused on finding scientifically validated solutions. This research highlights the importance of proper breast support, which remains a significant issue for many women. As awareness grows, it could reshape how we approach women's health and product design in the lingerie industry.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Women suffering from breast pain could benefit from better support options, improving their daily comfort and quality of life.",
    "This research could signal a shift in the lingerie market, encouraging brands to invest in scientifically-backed designs that prioritize women's health."

    "eli12": "Joanna Wakefield-Scurr's journey started with her own breast pain, leading her to explore better bra designs. Think of it like finding the right pair of shoes; just as shoes can support your feet, a well-designed bra can support the body. This research matters because it could lead to healthier, more comfortable options for women everywhere.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, Wakefield-Scurr's work highlights a significant user need for scientifically-backed lingerie. By focusing on comfort and support, brands could not only enhance user satisfaction but also differentiate themselves in a crowded market. This could lead to increased sales and customer loyalty.",
    "engineer": "Wakefield-Scurr's research emphasizes biomechanics, particularly how breast movement affects comfort and health. Her team is likely exploring dynamic models to analyze breast motion, which could inform better design practices. While results are still forthcoming, the potential for new standards in bra design is significant."
