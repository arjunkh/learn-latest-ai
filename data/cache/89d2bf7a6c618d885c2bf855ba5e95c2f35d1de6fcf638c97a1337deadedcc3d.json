  "raw_body": "The latest big headline in AI isn’t model size or multimodality — it’s the capacity crunch. At VentureBeat’s latest AI Impact stop in NYC, Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at WEKA, joined Matt Marshall, VentureBeat CEO, to discuss what it really takes to scale AI amid rising latency, cloud lock-in, and runaway costs.\nThose forces, Bercovici argued, are pushing AI toward its own version of surge pricing. Uber famously introduced surge pricing, bringing real-time market rates to ridesharing for the first time. Now, Bercovici argued, AI is headed toward the same economic reckoning — especially for inference — when the focus turns to profitability.\n\"We don't have real market rates today. We have subsidized rates. That’s been necessary to enable a lot of the innovation that’s been happening, but sooner or later — considering the trillions of dollars of capex we’re talking about right now, and the finite energy opex — real market rates are going to appear; perhaps next year, certainly by 2027,\" he said. \"When they do, it will fundamentally change this industry and drive an even deeper, keener focus on efficiency.\"\nThe economics of the token explosion\n\"The first rule is that this is an industry where more is more. More tokens equal exponentially more business value,\" Bercovici said. \nBut so far, no one's figured out how to make that sustainable. The classic business triad — cost, quality, and speed — translates in AI to latency, cost, and accuracy (especially in output tokens). And accuracy is non-negotiable. That holds not only for consumer interactions with agents like ChatGPT, but for high-stakes use cases such as drug discovery and business workflows in heavily regulated industries like financial services and healthcare.\n\"That’s non-negotiable,\" Bercovici said. \"You have to have a high amount of tokens for high inference accuracy, especially when you add security into the mix, guardrail models, and quality models. Then you’re trading off latency and cost. That’s where you have some flexibility. If you can tolerate high latency, and sometimes you can for consumer use cases, then you can have lower cost, with free tiers and low cost-plus tiers.\" \nHowever, latency is a critical bottleneck for AI agents. “These agents now don't operate in any singular sense. You either have an agent swarm or no agentic activity at all,” Bercovici noted.\nIn a swarm, groups of agents work in parallel to complete a larger objective. An orchestrator agent — the smartest model — sits at the center, determining subtasks and key requirements: architecture choices, cloud vs. on-prem execution, performance constraints, and security considerations. The swarm then executes all subtasks, effectively spinning up numerous concurrent inference users in parallel sessions. Finally, evaluator models judge whether the overall task was successfully completed.\n“These swarms go through what's called multiple turns, hundreds if not thousands of prompts and responses until the swarm convenes on an answer,” Bercovici said. \n“And if you have a compound delay in those thousand turns, it becomes untenable. So latency is really, really important. And that means typically having to pay a high price today that's subsidized, and that's what's going to have to come down over time.”\nReinforcement learning as the new paradigm\nUntil around May of this year, agents weren't that performant, Bercovici explained. And then context windows became large enough, and GPUs available enough, to support agents that could complete advanced tasks, like writing reliable software. It's now estimated that in some cases, 90% of software is generated by coding agents. Now that agents have essentially come of age, Bercovici noted, reinforcement learning is the new conversation among data scientists at some of the leading labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini, who view it as a critical path forward in AI innovation..\n\"The current AI season is reinforcement learning. It blends many of the elements of training and inference into one unified workflow,” Bercovici said. “It’s the latest and greatest scaling law to this mythical milestone we’re all trying to reach called AGI — artificial general intelligence,” he added. \"What’s fascinating to me is that you have to apply all the best practices of how you train models, plus all the best practices of how you infer models, to be able to iterate these thousands of reinforcement learning loops and advance the whole field.\"\nThe path to AI profitability \nThere’s no one answer when it comes to building an infrastructure foundation to make AI profitable, Bercovici said, since it's still an emerging field. There’s no cookie-cutter approach. Going all on-prem may be the right choice for some — especially frontier model builders — while being cloud-native or running in a hybrid environment may be a better path for organizations looking to innovate agilely and responsively. Regardless of which path they choose initially, organizations will need to adapt their AI infrastructure strategy as their business needs evolve.\n\"Unit economics are what fundamentally matter here,\" said Bercovici. \"We are definitely in a boom, or even in a bubble, you could say, in some cases, since the underlying AI economics are being subsidized. But that doesn’t mean that if tokens get more expensive, you’ll stop using them. You’ll just get very fine-grained in terms of how you use them.\" \nLeaders should focus less on individual token pricing and more on transaction-level economics, where efficiency and impact become visible, Bercovici concludes. \nThe pivotal question enterprises and AI companies should be asking, Bercovici said, is “What is the real cost for my unit economics?”\nViewed through that lens, the path forward isn’t about doing less with AI — it’s about doing it smarter and more efficiently at scale.",

  "speedrun": "AI is facing a capacity crunch, highlighted by rising latency, cloud lock-in, and soaring costs. At a recent event, Val Bercovici from WEKA warned that the industry could soon experience a surge pricing model similar to ridesharing, as current subsidized rates won't last. He predicts that by 2027, real market rates will emerge, forcing a sharper focus on efficiency. This shift is crucial as AI moves toward profitability amidst escalating operational and capital expenses.",

Think of it like a crowded highway; if too many cars are on the road, travel times increase, and costs rise. This matters because it could affect the quality and speed of AI services that people rely on every day.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, this capacity crunch means re-evaluating how AI tools are built and used. As costs rise, understanding user needs and finding efficient solutions will be essential. This could lead to innovations that balance cost and performance, ensuring products remain viable in a competitive market.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the capacity crunch highlights the importance of managing latency and cost in AI systems. Bercovici emphasized that achieving high inference accuracy requires a significant number of tokens, which can increase operational costs. Engineers may need to explore more efficient architectures and reinforcement learning strategies to optimize performance while managing these challenges."
