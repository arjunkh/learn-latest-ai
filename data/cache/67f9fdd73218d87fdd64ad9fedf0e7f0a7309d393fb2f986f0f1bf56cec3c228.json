  "speedrun": "ColPali is a new approach that integrates vision-language intelligence into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This innovation allows AI to better understand and utilize non-textual content, enhancing knowledge retrieval. By combining visual and textual data, ColPali could significantly improve information accuracy and relevance. This matters now as organizations increasingly rely on diverse data types for decision-making.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "Organizations using RAG systems will find it easier to extract insights from images and videos, improving their knowledge management processes.",
    "This shift reflects a broader trend towards integrating multi-modal data, which could redefine how AI systems operate in various industries."

  "lenses": {
    "eli12": "ColPali helps AI understand both images and text, much like how we use pictures and words together to tell a story. This means AI can pull information from a wider range of sources, making it smarter and more helpful. For everyday people, this could lead to better search results and more relevant information in apps they use.",
    "pm": "For product managers, ColPali highlights a new user need for systems that can process both visual and textual data. This could lead to more efficient knowledge retrieval, saving users time and effort. A practical implication is the potential for developing tools that streamline information access, enhancing user experience.",
    "engineer": "ColPali integrates vision-language models into RAG frameworks, improving the retrieval process by leveraging both images and text. This approach could lead to better accuracy in information retrieval, as it combines data types that were previously siloed. However, the implementation complexity may increase, requiring careful consideration of model training and data integration."
