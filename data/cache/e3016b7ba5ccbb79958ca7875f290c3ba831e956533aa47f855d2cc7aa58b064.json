    "eli12": "Expanded carrier screening checks for hidden genetic issues in parents that might affect their kids. Think of it like a health check-up before starting a family. It’s important because it can help families prepare for potential challenges and make choices about their future.",
    "pm": "For product managers, expanded carrier screening highlights a growing user need for genetic health insights. This could lead to innovative healthcare solutions that improve efficiency in family planning. Understanding this trend helps in designing products that meet evolving consumer demands.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, expanded carrier screening utilizes advanced genetic testing methods to analyze a broader range of mutations. This could involve using next-generation sequencing technologies that offer higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. However, the effectiveness and cost-benefit of such comprehensive testing may still need further evaluation."
