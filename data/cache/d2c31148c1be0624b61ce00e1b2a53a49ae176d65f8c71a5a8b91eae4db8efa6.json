  "speedrun": "In a recent selection process, a newsroom identified four technologies that did not make the cut for their 2026 breakthroughs list. These technologies, while innovative, were deemed less impactful compared to the final ten selected. This highlights the competitive nature of technological advancements and how some ideas, despite their promise, may not meet the criteria for immediate relevance. Understanding these exclusions helps us grasp the evolving landscape of innovation.",
  "why_it_matters": [
    "For tech enthusiasts, it signals which innovations might be less prioritized in the near future, shaping investment and development focus.",

    "eli12": "The newsroom picks ten breakthrough technologies each year, but not all ideas make the list. Four technologies were left out this time, showing how tough it is to choose what’s truly important. This matters because it helps us see which innovations might be on the rise or decline, affecting everyone from investors to everyday users.",
    "pm": "For product managers and founders, knowing which technologies were excluded from the breakthroughs list can inform product strategy. It highlights user needs that may not be fully addressed yet. By focusing on the selected breakthroughs, they can align their products with market demands and avoid investing in less impactful areas.",
    "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the selection process emphasizes rigorous evaluation criteria for breakthrough technologies. It suggests that metrics like scalability, user adoption rates, and potential for disruption are critical in determining a technology's future. Engineers should consider these factors when developing new innovations to ensure they meet industry expectations."
