        "eli12": "The DDFT is like a stress test for language models, checking how well they hold up when information gets tricky. Instead of just seeing what they know, it looks at how they cope when facts get fuzzy or misleading. This is important for everyday people because it means AI could become more trustworthy and useful in situations where accuracy is crucial.",
        "pm": "For product managers and founders, the DDFT highlights the need for robust AI that can handle real-world challenges. It suggests that focusing solely on model size isn't enough; understanding how models verify information is crucial. This insight could lead to better user experiences and more reliable products in the market.",
        "engineer": "From a technical perspective, the DDFT evaluates language models using a two-system cognitive model that separates text generation from factual verification. The study assessed nine models across eight knowledge domains and found that error detection capability is a strong predictor of robustness. This indicates that current design paradigms may overlook critical factors influencing a model's reliability."
