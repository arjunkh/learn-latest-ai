      "speedrun": "A new framework called LINKO has been introduced to improve how medical concepts are represented in electronic health records. By using large language models, LINKO allows for dual-axis knowledge propagation, integrating information from multiple ontology systems simultaneously. This method enhances the understanding of medical concepts by linking related ideas across different categories. Its significance lies in its ability to improve predictions, especially in cases with limited data or rare diseases.",
      "why_it_matters": [
        "Healthcare professionals could benefit from more accurate medical data interpretations, leading to better patient care.",
        "This approach could indicate a shift towards more integrated AI systems in healthcare, enhancing overall data utility."

        "eli12": "LINKO is like a translator that connects different languages of medical knowledge. Instead of just translating one language at a time, it understands and relates multiple languages simultaneously. This could help doctors make better decisions by providing a clearer picture of a patient's health. Improved data representation matters because it could lead to better treatment outcomes for patients.",
        "pm": "For product managers, LINKO represents a way to enhance existing electronic health record systems. By integrating multiple ontology systems, it addresses user needs for comprehensive data insights. This could lead to cost savings in data processing and improved efficiency in healthcare delivery. The practical implication is that EHR systems could become more effective tools for healthcare providers.",
        "engineer": "Technically, LINKO employs a dual-axis approach for knowledge propagation, enhancing concept representation learning across multiple ontology graphs. It uses large language models to initialize concept embeddings and performs vertical and horizontal propagation within and across hierarchical levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate LINKO's superior performance compared to existing models, particularly in scenarios with sparse data and rare disease predictions."
