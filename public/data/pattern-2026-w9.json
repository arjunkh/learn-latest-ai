      "summary": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) is changing how education assesses student performance. A recent study benchmarks various uncertainty metrics used in LLM-based grading, revealing that while these models are flexible, they also introduce significant uncertainty in results. This uncertainty can affect feedback and instructional decisions, potentially disrupting student learning. Understanding these metrics is crucial for developing more reliable grading systems.",
