        "engineer": "From a technical perspective, semantic entity resolution leverages language models for tasks like schema alignment and blocking, which traditionally faced n² complexity challenges. By utilizing representation learning, it enhances the system's ability to discern meaning within records, automating the matching and merging processes. This method potentially reduces the reliance on manual interventions and outdated statistical methods."
