      "summary": "Separating logic from inference in AI agents enhances scalability by decoupling workflows from execution strategies. This shift addresses reliability issues, as large language models (LLMs) can produce inconsistent results—what works once might not work again. By creating a more stable foundation, development teams can improve performance in production-grade applications. This matters now because as AI moves from prototypes to real-world use, reliability becomes crucial for user trust and adoption.",
