      "speedrun": "A new protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) proposes using multiple isolated systems to ensure they self-modify correctly. These systems, or 'boxes', cannot communicate with humans or each other directly, relying instead on a submission interface. They validate each other's alignment proofs through a reputation system, promoting honesty. This matters now as it offers a structured way to tackle the alignment challenge, crucial for the safe development of superintelligent AI.",

They write down their choices, check each other's preferences, and only go with what most agree on. This new protocol for ASI works similarly, ensuring that intelligent systems can align their goals without misleading each other. This matters for everyday people because it could lead to safer AI that acts in everyone’s best interest.",
        "pm": "For product managers and founders, this protocol highlights a user need for safety in AI development. By leveraging isolated systems that verify each other's alignment, companies could reduce the risks associated with AI misalignment. Practically, this means investing in robust verification systems could enhance product credibility and user trust.",
        "engineer": "From a technical perspective, this protocol emphasizes mutual verification among diverse ASIs operating in isolation. Each superintelligence submits alignment proofs and validates others, creating a reputation system that incentivizes accuracy. While it requires significant computational resources, it offers a framework for addressing the alignment problem, which is critical as AI systems become more advanced."
