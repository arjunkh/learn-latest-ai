        "eli12": "Blueprint-Bench is like a test that checks if AI can turn pictures of rooms into accurate floor plans. The study found that many AI models, including popular ones, often fail at this task, performing worse than random guesses. This matters because if AI can't understand spaces well, it won't be useful for things like home design or real estate apps.",
        "pm": "For product managers, Blueprint-Bench highlights a critical user need: effective spatial reasoning in AI. If AI models can't accurately interpret space, it could lead to poor user experiences in applications like home design tools. Understanding these limitations could help prioritize features that enhance spatial intelligence in future products.",
        "engineer": "From a technical perspective, Blueprint-Bench evaluates AI models like GPT-5 and Claude 4 on their ability to generate floor plans from images. The benchmark uses a dataset of 50 apartments and measures performance against ground-truth layouts. Notably, many models perform below a random baseline, indicating significant room for improvement in spatial reasoning capabilities."
