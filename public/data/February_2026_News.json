Understanding this helps everyone, as it may affect how LLMs are used in everyday situations like hiring or medical advice.",

Users expect AI to make rational choices, but emotional influences can lead to unexpected results. Therefore, ensuring that LLMs can balance logic and emotion could enhance user trust and satisfaction in AI-driven applications.",
        "engineer": "The study evaluates LLMs across benchmarks that test rational choice and decision-making influenced by emotions. It employs methods like in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS) to assess how emotional factors affect LLM outputs. While ICP shows significant shifts, it lacks calibratability, whereas RLS offers more realistic patterns but with less reliability. These findings reveal the complex interplay between reasoning capabilities and emotional influences in AI decision-making."
